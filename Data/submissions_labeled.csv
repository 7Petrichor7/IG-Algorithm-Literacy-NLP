Unlike the Google search engine where the demand is simply the number of searches, on Instagram and other social media platforms where the content finds the users the algorithm must predict what people will want to see.

ÔªøÔªø‚ÄúWe make a set of predictions. These are educated guesses at how likely you are to interact with a post in different ways. There are roughly a dozen of these. In Feed, the five interactions we look at most closely are how likely you are to spend a few seconds on a post, comment on it, like it, save it, and tap on the profile photo. The more likely you are to take an action, and the more heavily we weigh that action, the higher up you‚Äôll see the post.‚Äù

 Basically it is because instagram is more likely to show you on the explore page if you have had a lot of interactions in the ""past few weeks"". The most important part of this is that they sum the interactions as opposed to averaging. This leads to a value of quantity over quality and its much easier to have high quantity by stealing.

146,"Hi, my name is Jake Tilk. I‚Äôm an Instagram and Entrepreneurial YouTuber with 2.3k subscribers and over 350,000 followers on my Instagram Theme Pages. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôd like to talk about how you can go viral on Instagram.
 
To start this off - I need you guys to understand one simple concept.
 
That is, the Instagram Algorithm.
 
Imagine you‚Äôre surfing; And the waves of the surf are the Instagram algorithm. When the wave is up, that‚Äôs when content on Instagram is being pushed the hardest. When the wave is down, you as the surfer are waiting for it to go back up. So the key to us going viral on Instagram is to get our Instagram account to the top of the wave and ride the wave as long as we can to achieve virality. Seems simple, right?
 
Now, all waves come crashing down. So when that happens, we want to get on the next wave as soon as possible. The key is, we want to grow our account to the point where it is a massive boat that the waves or in this case, Instagram algorithm can‚Äôt ignore, they‚Äôre left with no choice but to push us (this is around 3-5k followers depending on the niche).
 
Now, there isn‚Äôt a single distinct strategy that I‚Äôve learned about that will guarantee virality on Instagram, so we want to take it into our own hands. Let‚Äôs assume we started a brand new account and we‚Äôre chillin here with a measly zero followers for a moment. What is the first thing you would do?
 
Well, let‚Äôs take these key points to set up our profile to make sure it is optimized for success on the gram. Meaning we will want our profile to match every single one of these criteria or people won‚Äôt really want to follow us.
 
Handle
-Clean (No periods, numbers, or underscores)
-Searchable (Instagram is a giant search engine, make your content searchable)
-Recognizable (Doesn‚Äôt blend in with the pack)
 
Name
-Clean (Describes what your content is about i.e. Dog Videos if you are posting dog videos)
-Searchable (Same as above)
-Value Expectations (Let people know what kind of ‚Äòvalue‚Äô they can expect from your page)
 
Profile Picture
-Clean (Why do you have blurry profile pics or tons of little words no one can read, dude?)
-Recognizable (Make it simple and iconic)
-Matches highlight cover photos (Match the cover photos with your profile picture so that your page looks FIRE)
 
Highlights
-Clean
-Match Name
-Deliver value to keep people on IG longer (You want people to spend as much time on your page as possible)
 
Content
-Matches viewers expectations
-Delivers value (whether it‚Äôs entertainment or informational)
 
Now, the next thing we need to keep in mind is the concept of consistency. And for that, 2-3 times per day is my magic number for posting. Make sure you‚Äôre posting during peak times your audience is online in your audience insights. For me, that‚Äôs 9 am EST, 11 am EST, and 12 pm EST. I‚Äôm not going to lie to you though, consistency isn‚Äôt easy. The key that made this a million times easier for me is to use Facebook Creator Studio connected with my Instagram app.
 
But we can be as consistent as we want, but if we aren‚Äôt posting fire content that‚Äôs going to take us to the moon, isn‚Äôt the consistency part irrelevant?
 
Absolutely.
 
So what we need to do is use our content to leverage the Instagram algorithm to take us to the top of the wave, like we talked about earlier.
 
For content, there are four keys to success:
 
1. It‚Äôs clean and easy to understand
2. Delivers expected value
3. Virality component
4. Utilizing newest features (such as Reels)
 
But even with good content, you still need people to see your content, so let‚Äôs talk about gathering an audience. And to gather that base audience from zero, isn‚Äôt as hard as you think. We just need to get the account to 3-5k followers like I mentioned earlier.
 
The three strategies I‚Äôd recommend for this are:
 
1. Follow For Follow (F4F)
2. Tag Strategy
3. Comment Barrage Strategy (Upgraded $1.80)
 
I talk about how to do every single one of these on my channel. There is a playlist called ‚ÄòGet 100k on Instagram Organically‚Äô that I highly suggest you check out.
 
But rest assured, 1,000 followers in your first week is easy. So we‚Äôve used these strategies to get ourselves to 3-5k followers, so we should now be growing organically. From here, It‚Äôs easy street. We‚Äôre going to post a story letting everyone know our new post is live whenever we post one. And keep focusing on posting the most viral content out there because you know what we‚Äôve started doing? Riding the wave that is the Instagram algorithm, and it‚Äôs getting bigger. The post keeps getting more and more likes and views, keeping people on Instagram‚Äôs platform longer until we‚Äôve done it.

155,"Hello again.   
I have always loved art and making art of my own and I always considered art making fun. About a year ago, though, I started finding it very hard to make art I was happy with. My skill level was pretty decent for my age, but I was never content with my work.  Recently I have tried very hard to study the human figure and anatomy and I am finally at a point where I can look at my most recent works and say ""Hey, that's pretty good"", but that feeling usually disappears after a day or so.   

To make it easier on myself, I started drawing my own characters - which of course didn't get me very far in the Instagram algorithm, but I was happy to get my characters out there anyway. I hardly get noticed though, and I don't think I'm a half bad artist! I'm constantly trying to get better, and I am happy with my own improvement when I think about it.  

What went wrong? Did making art start feeling less like a fun hobby and more like a tiring job for anyone else? I feel as if my hard work goes to waste most of the time.

Plus, there‚Äôs the¬†[Instagram algorithm](https://evereach.media/blogs/instagram-seo-tactics-to-bring-you-more-business-success/)¬†making it even harder for manufacturers to stands out.

Which means that so as to create high-quality Instagram content material, you want an motion plan and technique in place for planning, taking pictures, modifying, and posting your content material.

## Why is Excessive High quality Instagram Content material so Essential?¬†

Let‚Äôs discuss concerning the[¬†Instagram algorithm](https://evereach.media/blogs/instagram-seo-tactics-to-bring-you-more-business-success/). It will get quite a lot of dangerous rep, and companies have undoubtedly discovered it tougher to develop their Instagram account because it modified. However it‚Äôs vital to understand that the algorithm isn‚Äôt stopping you from rising, it‚Äôs simply altering¬†*how*¬†you may develop.

Having high-quality Instagram content material is extra vital than ever earlier than. If we expect again to the early years of Instagram, it was rather a lot simpler to develop a following with low-quality photographs and sporadic posting.

However now, consistency is vital and also you want to have the ability to usually produce and publish content material that your viewers goes to love and interact with.

And as soon as the algorithm picks up that you simply‚Äôre creating content material that resonates along with your viewers, it places you and your posts in a greater place and in entrance of recent audiences.a

The second motive why high-quality Instagram content material is vital is as a result of it offers you one other alternative to monetize your account.

A lot of manufacturers and companies need to¬†[collaborate with Instagram influencers](https://evereach.media/blogs/tips-to-become-a-perfect-instagram-marketer/)¬†and bloggers to create content material for his or her web site, or Instagram account. So if you happen to can showcase one of the best work in your Instagram account, it might change into an superior portfolio in your abilities and might open up alternatives to work with nice manufacturers, collaborate on social media tasks, and receives a commission in your Instagram content material!

However creating nice Instagram content material doesn‚Äôt simply occur in a single day! Placing a while, effort and creativity into your Instagram content material actually does repay.

**Right here‚Äôs our 4-step plan that will help you kick-start your Instagram content material technique:**

## Step #1: Instagram Content material Planning

Earlier than you begin, it is best to ask your self these two questions:

Firstly, what sort of content material aligns along with your model? And what does your viewers need to see?

With the ability to pinpoint the who, what and why about your Instagram model is a very vital step for planning out your content material. If what your model is about, and what sort of content material your viewers likes to have interaction in, you‚Äôll actually be capable of hone in, and create the proper sort of content material from the beginning.

Discovering your model area of interest and actually dedicating your efforts to only that area of interest will repay. Plenty of Instagram accounts get sidetracked with posting content material exterior of their audience and area of interest, and that might be slowing down your development.

So if you happen to‚Äôre a meals enterprise, plan your content material so it‚Äôs 100% based mostly round meals (and never selfies out of your vacay!). This degree of focusing on, and never straying out of your model area of interest, is admittedly vital if you wish to develop your Instagram account.

When you‚Äôve answered these two questions, you will get all the way down to planning your content material for the week forward.

Begin by making a listing of all the pieces that you simply‚Äôll need to publish in your Instagram web page this week (or longer if you happen to‚Äôre feeling super-organized!). Simply ensure you have selection in your week‚Äôs content material. For instance, if you happen to‚Äôre a vogue blogger, you may need to have 4 outfit photographs, and three flat lays this week that you would be able to combine and match from.

Top-of-the-line time-saving suggestions is to plan out your photoshoots for a particular day and get content material for a number of days value of Instagram posts. For instance, on Monday, you would determine to take pictures in your outfit photographs after which on Friday, dedicate your time to flat lay photographs.

With the ability to batch your shoots collectively like this protects you a lot time in the long term as you may collect content material that shall be posted possibly weeks into the longer term!

264,"We have a bare idea now of how the Instagram algorithm works, and though it does suck, your post is shown to a fraction of your followers and only of they interact engagingly would it be pedelled through to larger masses. So if you've any chance of ending up on the explorer page, you've to make your posts interesting enough to promote engagement. 

DISCLAIMER: Mine is more of a fashion, travel, lifestyle based personal account and I really think this would work more to people in that niche. Though worry not, some of these would work for everyone. These aren't professional advice and I am no professional of any sort some of it might even seem weird so please remember this is just my experience of what worked for me.

1) Likes for Engagement : We're aware that likes = engagement and this is an easy way to increase traffic to your post organically especially as close to posting time as possible to trick the algorithm into peddle the post to more users. This might seem weird or even unorthodox, but use the hashtags #likeforlikes. Go to the hashtag, and check out the recent pictures and... LIKE THEM! This would prompt those users to visit your profile and like your recent back driving traffic and engagement towards you. Sounds easy doesn't it? Actually, not really. It took me lots of experimenting to find a way to make this work. 

You have to be diligent about the posts to give your likes to. Choose the most recent posts posted seconds ago and with minimal (below 10) likes. Go to their profile and spam like at least 4-6 of their recent posts. This hashtag is one of the most used on Instagram you can refresh it every second to find a lot of new posts from different profiles. I have myself forced interaction towards my page this way by 100s of likes. My posts get an average of 1k likes but with this method I easily increase it to 1.5k or.. anything really. The best part is those users spam like you back as well so your old posts do gain attention well past its usual engagement times. And it's all organic!!
MAJOR CON: it's easy to get caught up in this liking spree and sometimes I have really good luck where I can gain an easy 50+ likes an hour and some days not so much.. but one thing to be aware of is that Instagram monitors excess activity such as liking too much (yes this a thing that exists and I found out the hard way) and they will restrict your activity for 12 hourS. A limit that I figured out for myself is, visit no more than 100 profiles via the hashtag per day and like no more than 5-6 of their posts. 

2. This is directed mostly towards fellow aspiring influencers. 
     1. Make sure your profile pic is something that would attract attention and want people to check your profile out. 
     2. Go to a famous (1M-ish followers) shout out page that shout outs models etc. It's bound to be full of horny men lol
     3. Go to the likes of the most recent post, even better set a notification alert for when the page posts and there will be instant likes, go to those profiles (usually old men), make sure they have a high following to followers ratio, these are the people more likely to follow you back, and like one recent post. I say just 1 because these are people who follow tons of models already so all they need is to show them you exist and they will go over to your page and follow back. I've only used this method since recently and I've gone up by 1k followers within 2 weeks.

Obviously it is a problem because this defeats the purpose of the posts more or less, but I would love to know if there is a cut and dry reason or strong circumstantial evidence.

My username is [instagram.com/michaellebson/](https://www.instagram.com/michaellebson/) and I went on a streak of posting my animations as reels recently.  I am a visual artist, primarily a painter, but my work translates into animations very well, since simple shapes painted in grid-like formations create looping animations with some variety and texture.  So point is, my animations are short videos (15 seconds or less) that just loop over and over the same 8/10/16/etc frame animation.

I changed from a business account to a creator account about 2 weeks ago so I could utilize music for the videos (This could be a problem potentially).  I had a few videos get up to around 1500 views so I figured this is the way to go since I don't have too many followers yet (around 550 but started from 413 about 2 months ago).  

My last 2 videos however have only been seen by followers - it is circumstantial evidence but the fact that on these last two quite literally only followers have liked them (as opposed to every other post I've ever done that included hashtags) leads me to believe there is something going on.  I posted 2 reels last Friday which did well, and then the one on Saturday was not liked by a single non-follower with much fewer views than I would assume for the post. I had not posted until today - my phone was stuck in a time lapse photo shoot for about 3 days.  I've heard of shadowbans and what not, and also my speculation regarding the first post not receiving likes/views from non-followers led me to avoid certain hashtags for the one I just posted today - maybe the algorithm didn't like #candy #sweetarts and bright color animation with a Kanye song, the whole brand name with music on the cheap type thing.  

I posted with 30 hashtags today, mostly digital art and abstract art related things.  

If anyone could go on my page and see what the problem could be it would be extremely appreciated.  Like most artists I believe in my work and post daily, so it is pretty demoralizing when 8 hours of work is not seen by anyone, which I think is an understandable sentiment.  I don't believe that 0 non-followers would like the last 2 posts, the first of these 2 in question was especially good (pink, used candy, Kanye - Dark Fantasy used), so I don't think this is just a coincidence.   

So, if anyone knows if these videos aren't best for Reels, or if there are certain things the IG algorithm doesn't like, or anything else, I am all ears!!

My question is will people I interact with on account A show up as ""suggested"" to people I interact with on account B?

I've interacted with people on instagram and would always get their friends as my ""suggested"". It concerns me a bit if that same algorithm is transgressing through different accounts; ie. suggesting account A's people to account B's people. 

Because I've heard of scenarios where people had their alts/finstas uncovered through the ""suggested"" tab, due to the algorithm. But would the algorithm go as far as suggesting people you interact with on SEPARATE accounts?

Ok so like everyone else I hate the Instagram Algorithm. It‚Äôs 2021 and things aren‚Äôt getting any better for smaller accounts. I am a lifestyle + beauty page that‚Äôs been up for 10+ years. It started out as a private account that I made public many years ago. Granted I wasn‚Äôt consistently making content until last year (2020) but since then my reach and growth has been SO slow. And I know what people will say (content is stale, not posting at peak time blah blah.) I‚Äôve tried it ALL. I know that I could spice up my content but I‚Äôve just been feeling SO defeated and overwhelmed because even when I make GREAT content that outperforms my other content the reach is still THE SAME. 

It‚Äôs not a secret that Instagram favors bigger accounts making it harder for small accounts to grow. Recently I‚Äôve been considering starting all over with a new account because I took a class from an IG coach who essentially told me that my account may be flagged because of some things I did on my account in the past. (Follow unfollow method) 

My question is though, does IG truly punish your account for stuff like that? Even if you‚Äôre a small account? I only did this to get to 1000 followers in the past. And then recently right before I was about to hit 2000 followers I went on a removing spree and removed pretty much any ghost follower I could find. But then I learned after that you‚Äôre not supposed to do that. So anyway Idk what to do - start a new account or try to salvage what I have already?

Finally, a top news source does a story on Instagram that shows the frustration people have with the Instagram algorithm. I'm tired of the erratic hashtag reach. I had three posts in a row with over 2k reach with about 80% of that being from people who don't follow me. Then I do a new post today, and my reach is below 400 with only 2% reaching non-followers and literally 5 reach from hashtags. The other three posts had almost 2000 reach from hashtags. This whole cycle just keeps repeating itself, 2-3 weeks of fantastic reach and growth, then 2-3 weeks of absolute garbage reach, and no, I'm not spamming hashtags. I use relevant hashtags, spread between small and big hashtags, and I change them up every post. 

The problem is certainly not my content. I do astrophotography and my images are excellent (I've been published a couple times in magazines). I try to mix it up with stories, reels, and regular posts. But according to this article we need to be doing two stories a day, 3 posts a week, 4-7 reels a week, and 1-3 IGTV videos a week, or we won't grow. Instagram says people are never penalized for not posting reels...a nice play on words I think. They can say we aren't being penalized, but people who do post are being pushed higher in the algorithm. Technically not penalized, but really it is. 

I can't post more than one or two astrophotos a week because it takes a LONG time to image and acquire the data, and it takes a LONG time to process the data into a good image. I'm sure the same applies to artists and other types of creative Instagrammers as well. If they want us to spend that much time and effort to make that much content for Instagram, then we might as well do it on YouTube instead and get paid for our efforts...which is what I'm about to do soon. I know Instagram says they are going to start monetizing content, but they've been saying that for a while now. They want us to pay for ads, but they don't want to pay us for our time and effort. Then they outright LIE when my reach on some posts is ridiculously low and they send me a notification saying ""This post is doing better than 85% of your recent posts"" and then want me to boost it? How can that even remotely be true? It's clear what they want...money. And generally, I don't have a problem with that. Instagram exists to make money, I get it. But at least YouTube pays their content creators. 

What pisses me off more than anything is that Instagram won't just plainly tell us why reach is limited. Why can't they just come out and tell us the truth? Why can't they be more transparent about the algorithm? Instagrammers are constantly just left scratching their heads not knowing what to do. While it is really frustrating for me, ultimately it's not a big deal because my livelihood doesn't depend on Instagram. But it's horrible for real businesses that depend on it.

[""Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 11am and Tuesday at 2pm are now the best time to post on Instagram.""](https://www.contentcal.io/blog/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-2020/) 

And it's not mind blowing because it's amazing that we have solved the question, but because it's ridiculous that such nonsense analysis is being pushed as fact. That blog post actually references all of it's data from [this by sproutsocial](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#times-ig).

So let's breakdown why these blog posts are pure garbage:

Crime 1: Treating 20,000 accounts worth of data as one homogenous block

This means that the averages they are using are completely detached from the actual reality of how Instagram works. No two accounts will ever have the exact same set of followers (realistically), so while it is very likely that your followers' 'Most Active Times' will be similar to someone else's, you should never be basing your decisions on someone else's data. It just doesn't make sense, Instagram happily shows you the exact time/day when your followers are active. That's the first place you should start. 

Crime 2: Using 'engagements' as the metric to measure success.

So the best times to post have been calculated by total engagements. Not engagement rate... engagements. This is easier to explain with a small example: 

||Post A|Post B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Posted @|1pm|2pm|
|Engagements|10|12|
|Reach|10|20|
|Engagement Rate|100%|60%|

So Post A has received two fewer engagements than Post B. If we take the sproutsocial approach, in the data given above this means that Post B outperformed Post A. Therefore 2pm is the best time to post. But Post B had double the reach? It actually performed far worse than Post A when we take into account how many people saw the post and engaged with it. In the eyes of the Instagram algorithm... Post A is surely better. If we had posted Post A at 2pm, it may have performed far better in this time slot than Post B. 

This is why 'Reach' is surely a better metric to use than total engagements. We can see that the 2pm time slot had a higher 'Reach' than the 1pm time slot. The 2pm time slot is the best time slot, but not for the reason we were told it was. 

Essentially, the big crime being committed here is assuming that Post B and Post A are of the same quality. If you pick the best time slot to post some rubbish content, then you're still going to see rubbish results. It's not 2PM's fault that your photo was no good.

Crime 3: Ignoring the Instagram Algorithm

Due to the way the Instagram algorithm works, posting content during a period where you know your followers are online, does not guarantee that your content will actually be seen by them. I've seen plenty of accounts where Reach and Online Followers does actually line up. In this situation you should basically post exactly when you have the most followers online. Congratulations! Your job is significantly easier. But this isn't true for everyone.

My own blog post alert: [you don't have to read it if you don't want to, I'm basically repeating what it says here](https://blog.socialfunnel.co.uk/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram/) 

So we've found that some accounts actually have negative correlation between Reach and Online Followers... the traditional wisdom can actually be backwards for your account. Posting during peak hours actually harms your Reach. This is kind of crazy because what you think is helping your account, is actually harming it.

Why? Because if your post is getting less reach... it has less chance of performing well, because less of your followers ever actually see it. This kind of makes sense though, right? If everyone thinks that 3pm on a Wednesday is the best time to post... then for some people it definitely won't be. You'll be way down the algorithm pecking order and buried under a sea of high performers. 

So in summary...

You have less than 50\~ Posts on Instagram:

You don't have enough posts to reliably find a correlation between Reach and Online Followers, so you should probably just post when Online Followers is highest to be safe. It wouldn't hurt to check if there's a correlation but keep in mind it is kind of a small sample size.

You have more than 50\~ Posts on Instagram:

Find out if you have a positive or negative correlation between your Reach and Online Followers. If it's negative, try posting during unpopular days/hours where you're already performing well (like how in the blog post I linked whilst Friday is a low day for Online Followers, it's the highest day for Reach). If it's positive, keep posting during high traffic hours and maybe try to post in higher traffic hours if you aren't already.

You can engage all day long, comment and like, but it wouldn't help if your content is not interesting and share-worthy. Why I'm writing here today is because I feel bad to see so many people asking about improving reach and are frustrated with this platform. I hope I'll be able to help. (FYI I've 19.4K followers.)

Key Steps

1. Create Viral Content: Now it's easy to say create viral content. But, as they say, where there is a will, there is a way. We have to first understand which content goes viral. Let me list some of the features of a viral content. a.) It's controversial; b.) It's entertaining; c.) It's motivating; 4.) It's unique; 5.) It's hilarious; 6.) It's emotional; 7.) It's grand; and 8.) It's debatable. 9.) It makes you think. 10.) It educates. Now depending upon your niche, you should try to create a post which has at least two of the above 10 features. The more features, the better. Maybe you can test it a couple of times and see the results. I'm sure your reach will be higher than what you're getting now. (Do tell me what other features do you feel we should add in the list.)
2. The First Impression: The first 15 minutes of your post are the most crucial minutes. If you manage to get a good number of likes or comments in the first 15 minutes, the post will be 100% successful. And that's why - the first impression of your post is extremely important. Before publishing your post, just look at it critically. Think if your post is making you feel ""WOW"" or ""GREAT"" or, simply ""It seems like a pretty good post."" If it's not WOW, don't post it. Yes, people say you should post regularly, at least 1 post everyday. Nope. You should post only your best posts. Even if you post once a week, or once a month, it has no affect on your engagement. (I've experienced this.) Your engagement is based only and only upon how interesting your content is.
3. The Caption: I've noticed whenever I put a question in the caption, I get replies. It always works. It's a sure way of getting more comments and hence more engagement.

That's all. Do these three steps well, and I'm sure you will see an improvement in your reach. The Instagram algorithm is made such that it's not there to help you. You'll have to fight it. Just think of your post as an object, a heavy object, that you are trying to push through a narrow tunnel. You can't push it alone. You'll need help. Help from the audience. And they will help only when they are receiving some value from the object.

The only thing that marketers should know to succeed in their [**Instagram marketing**](https://blog.ainfluencer.com/content-marketing/instagram-marketing-tips/) is going with Instagram algorithm change to update their marketing strategies to win this game.

As Instagram businesses know that the Instagram algorithm keeps changing and impact their marketing performance, they need to learn how it works differently for **feed posts, stories, the Explore page, IGTV** **videos, and Reels**. So we are here to make this algorithm easy to understand as one of the most important Instagram hacks.

## How does the Instagram algorithm work in2021

Gone are the days when the [Instagram algorithm](https://later.com/blog/how-instagram-algorithm-works/#stories)[ ](https://later.com/blog/how-instagram-algorithm-works/#stories)works based on the chronological rule that shows everyone‚Äôs Instagram feed in an organized way. Obviously, as an Instagram marketer, there is a big requirement to stand out; meanwhile, the Instagram algorithm acts mysteriously.

**Separate from the Instagram algorithm that is ever-changing, understanding your audience is the first step of cutting through the Instagram noises to become a champion Instagrammer.**

¬†The new Instagram algorithm is highly effective in driving Instagram engagement and letting brands stay on their feet. Therefore the battle is on the head of key factors that Instagram algorithm changes to help brands better appear at the top of Instagram users feed?

 

## 1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Instagram feed algorithm in 2021

Based on three prominent factors ¬†Instagram feed algorithm can change and distinctively arrange every Instagrammer feed.

* **Relationship:**

Instagram‚Äôs relationship includes the history of engagements a user made with other accounts. You follow the most important accounts, such as your friends, family, and favorite accounts. The algorithm will consider a meaningful connection to which types of accounts and followers are preferable for you or better interact with. Finding the relationship can be discovered by the algorithm via the following, you might have, from the accounts you **like their content**, **Send direct message**, **Search for** and **know in real life**.

**Tip: Instagram builds this relationship just after an Instagram user follows a new account and show you their content in your feed.**

* **Interest**:

An Instagram feed is all about an overview of your Instagram manners you have already have so far. It consists of two kinds of posts: your following accounts and the other Instagram posts you have already liked.

Interests mean interaction because users determine which kinds of accounts and content they want to interact with. Interaction on Instagram includes the Instagram tag in posts, the posts you like and comment on, shares, and saves. The algorithm wants to let the people the posts they want and enjoy.

**Tip: One effective way to make Instagrammers interact with your content is post consistency**

* **Timeliness:**

Separate form increasing Instagram engagement, Instagram algorithm focuses on the latest posts that have been just published on the platform. The Instagram algorithm update recommends the best time to post to serve the Instagrammers with the latest content. The newer, the better because brands can grow their Instagram pages easier by tracking the best time to post on Instagram, leading to increased reach and getting likes and followers on Instagram.

**Tip: knowing more about your audience demographic can help Instagram businesses know when to post on Instagram and generate more Instagram engagements.**

## 2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Instagram story algorithm in 2021

For instance, If you like, share, or comment on the Instagram accounts, you most prefer to follow their stories immediately appear above your Instagram profile.

Within Instagram stories, brands can put their activities. In front of many eyes, it is really more thoughtful of Instagram businesses to consider the Instagram story as a great way to increase their account‚Äôs exposure. The more Instagram stories they share, the more promotion Instagram posts deliver and announcing important events along with timeliness.

## 3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Instagram hashtag algorithm in 2021

Using Instagram, hashtags still works to beat the Instagram algorithm and grow your Instagram account. ¬†Finding the best [Instagram hashtags](https://later.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-using-instagram-hashtags/) can affect the Instagram algorithm to better your post reach the Instagram explore page.

To optimize and popular your profile, you need to promote your content with a set of hashtags strategy that delivers the new audience the relevant photos, captions, and content.

## 4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Instagram explore page algorithm in 2021

**To get on the Instagram Explore page, you must have at least 1k followers to reach a highly-targeted audience,** **increase brand awareness, and attract more followers and customers.**

Although every user on Instagram has a specific amount of following accounts, the Instagram explore page is useful for showing and organizing the most relevant Instagram content based on each Instagram user‚Äôs interest and much time spent. It works as a great indicator to form user and accounts relationships and effectively promote your Instagram business.

**Tip**: Two critical factors that are crucial to your success ¬†are **content strategy and Instagram engagement**, which refer to:

* **The number of getting tagged**
* **The appropriate hashtags you used**

**According to Kicksta, the best time to post to stand out and appear on user‚Äôs feeds.**

* Best Time/Day: Friday morning (9 am)
* Best Engagement: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday during work hours (8-5 pm)

Has this behavior ruined my reputation to the eyes of the Instagram algorithm and this would penalize me with getting new exposure when I'll start posting new photos as a photographer on that account as for OPTION 1, or can I still recover this mistakes and make up for them by posting again on my main personal account?  


OPTION 3:  


Having both accounts active and posting on both of them photos, I would post more photos on the photography one, but I would also post my best pics on my personal one.  


Would this posting 2 copies of the same photo on two different accounts make Instagram's algorithm raise an eyebrow about legitimacy? If I tagged both accounts on each photo, would this seem alright for instagram's algorithm as for copyright?  


Thanks a lot to whoever took the time to read this whole. I really appreciate your help.

So, with a group of people we are starting a non-profit and we have an instagram account. Recently, our posts weren't doing great so I checked the data (from fb creator studio).

Here are two graphs I made:

So, as you can see, there was a sudden drop around mid-October:

- Our posts are now barely shown to any non-subscribers
- The total amount of unique viewers for our posts got significantly smaller one day to the other...

I've been checking the hashtags used, the quality of the posts... but I honestly didn't find anything that could explain what happened!

The fact it was so sudden also tell me that something specific happened.

But the most important here is that to invert that trend we changed the hashtags we used, we tried posts a bit different... but nothing is working. It's like the IG algorithm is still, for three weeks now, ""soft shadow banning?"" us. Whatever we put our posts are now only shown to our current subscribers (and that seems to decrease as well!).

I don't want to post quick, unfinished drawings to my Instagram, during a time when so many artists are going to be posting gorgeous inked pieces. I get that my friends are trying to be encouraging, and that art isn't a competition, but I'm just embarrassed to be relearning my whole process, and essentially walking when everyone else is sprinting over hurdles.

So I stewed over the thing a bit, and while I simmered on my floor at 2am, I remembered a little post another friend had sent me a year ago. The post was titled ""Flexibility of the Word Fuck"" and basically showed many wonderful ways the word can be used. My friend mentioned that he read all of the examples in the voice of my D&amp;D character,  who is a surly, little Tiefling who tosses that word around like it's confetti. I always wanted to draw that character saying things from the list, but never got around to it.

So...what if I did try it? 

I expanded the list into 31prompts, turned them into a graphic, and called the whole thing *Fucktober.* 
I then posted this list to my Instagram, jokingly explained the rules and the hashtags in the most irreverent way possible, and decided to get cracking.

But as I was planning my drawings, my friend came to me with some concerns. He was worried that the post and hashtag were too aggressive. That the Instagram algorithm was going to bury it and that people might be put off by the whole thing, or worse think that I'm acting like I'm better than Inktober He worries that I'll be putting effort into things that might get diminishing returns. He's probably right.

Thing is... I was actually excited about Fucktober. It might be childish and niche, but it seemed like a fun way to channel all my anger and frustration at this garbage fire of a year. I do NOT think I'm better than Inktober, or Drawtober, or any other drawing challenge out there, I just wanted to do something that was mine. Because if it's my own goofy thing I can't really fail at it, can I? But I also don't want to come off as smug and aggressive to my followers, or bore them with something they're not interested in seeing. I don't want to do something all month that's going to bite me in the ass.

17,"Comment Bots are really famous among people who are new or old to the IG marketing. Comment not only helps you to attract attention of your targeted audience but also makes you to reach wide areas of your niche. 

Basically, when a normal human comments he looks at the photo and comments accordingly. But for bots the post are just a place to comment. 
Therefore, IG Experts are really precise about what kind of audience they are targeting and what bunch of comments they are using. 

Normally, A newbie puts the comment bot on run without even considering it's speed, type of audience, words in comment and sometimes even niche.

SO HOW IG ALGORITHM WORKS?

IG algorithm keeps check on comments of the account because comments are the most vulnerable tool which can be used for spamming. And if the algorithm finds that the comment done on posts are not relevant or repeating (same comment) over a large number of post. It considers it as spam. And soon or later, start blocking the Id or it's features. 

HOW TO OVERCOME IT?

The First thing you can do is avoid commenting bots over your ids.
I've developed IDs without using comment bots with a good engagement and followers gain (even 100+ followers a day). If you still want to use the comment features for gaining audience attention.
Do consider these things in your mind:

1.Try to be very much precise about the targeted audience. 
2. Use the bots which allows you a great variety of comments or help you to shuffle keywords.
3. Add your own comments to your bot. (For e.g. if it's art niche ""Great work, Lovely art, wonderful) or comments which seems relevant to the art niche.
4. Don't rush on using comment bots rather use them as cherry on cake. Like mixing nicely with other bots so that it could seem more human. 
5. Keep patience and observe how are the outcome of you settings.

136,"Hey guys, 

This can be long but I am sure it will be interesting. I am writing all of this from the core of my heart and I am sure somewhere out there, someone knowledgeable enough will read it and guide me accordingly. So a quick brief about myself, my name's Tanush, a 17 year old ""Indian"" (This is important) who just turned 18 a few days ago.  


So I am a graphic designer, I have worked with 100s of brands since last 3 years and I am sure they all were unaware of my age and hired me out of my portfolio. I don't want to judge my own designs, but I get great response from the community when they see my designs.  


Now India's a country where while being a high school student, generally they don't dream to start a business or work for businesses, and even if a student tries so, the community isn't much supportive, parents want their sons and daughters to study from a broken education system and live the rest of their lives working under a MNC after securing a degree. I won't blame the parents here, they just want their little ones to have a great and secured future rather than having a risky business but what this does is kills our creativity. Hence India generates one of the smartest minds and gets imported by abroad and foreign companies which is considered to be one of the greatest achievements here in India. ( India produces more engineers than US and China combined ) but they fail to generate creativity.  


Now, my parents unlike the majority are very very special, they understand me and my perspective, they agree to my stupid thoughts and needs, they never force me to do anything which I don't want, in short they are very very supportive. Now obviously, in return I always want to fulfill any wish they have, I feel like, ""Wow! They are so amazing, I have to fulfill any wish they have"", now obviously nothing's perfect, their only wish in exchange for their supportive nature was for me to be good academically. And unfortunately, I wasn't ( though I am above average ), I just didn't wanted to study things which won't be valuable to me in the future ( Our curriculum is very very outdated ).   
Still I have always felt very bad that they have always fulfilled all of  my wishes and are extraordinary parents but I couldn't fulfill just one wish of theirs. So I thought, if I earn good enough, if I will earn extraordinarily enough in my age, they will be happy that their son is talented enough to earn at a age when students spend the time of their day playing games. 

So as I loved computers, designing and solving problems with businesses, I used to read books which could increase my entrepreneurial and marketing knowledge (One of my favorite being the ""Influence | The Psychology of Persuasion"", I have completed over 25-30 courses in Udemy and I currently know to operate more than 6 Adobe Software. So everyday and night, I was wondering about problems which the world had, and ways to solve them (to me this is what business is). Opened several of them, and closed without seeing much profit and then one day I sat to re-evaluate myself and my mistakes and that is when I realized that I was not giving enough time for each of those businesses to flourish. I wasn't giving enough of my dedication to any of them. But often, I used to doubt myself, that really will a 17 year old be able to earn enough or start businesses, if this would be so easy, why people so experienced and aged would struggle to do so. But somewhere down my heart, I wanted to prove the age factor wrong.

Though at that time I also used to carry out part time and freelance jobs. So fortunately, I was little successful at earning, Getting $200 per month through freelance jobs which is a big deal here at the age of 16 was something which I was able to do, so they were satisfied that I am skillful enough to earn without being good academically. But I wanted to make them 'very proud' so I had bigger dreams, I wanted to buy my mom the dream house she ever wanted as soon as possible ( because I have this strange and weird fear of the death of my parents, and I want to achieve things as soon as possible at least so that they can see that they were successful at making their son a great and successful person and go very very happily and peacefully ), I wanted to be one of the most youngest entrepreneur the country has seen and don't worry, I am very very against of 'get rich quick schemes'. I believe in the hard work that goes into earning.

So, now you know the little background of mine, and back to current situation. So now, after evaluating all of my mistakes and understanding what I am excellent at, I opened a company which served Social Media Management services by making beautiful content 5-7 days a week with mesmerizing caption copy ( I did hire a talented copywriter for this and 2-3 more people for better management) and I posted our portfolio in one of the Facebook groups, and instantly few people approached from all around the world and I successfully closed two of them from Portland and Australia respectively, It's been 4 months, and we produced beautiful and engaging posts for them and even successfully carried some marketing campaigns as well. Through my experience of last 2 years, I had little knowledge about the Instagram algorithm as well, so I was able to successfully bump up their engagement rates as well. So now this so called company of mine is generating more than 600$ monthly, (though not much profit is left, but I don't want to secure profit right now). But something inside me was telling me, if I secured just 2 clients without any much effort and helped them with their problem of social presence then over the world, there must be so so so many companies who are in need of the same services, I searched through Fiverr and all, and people are charging hundreds of dollars for designs which are no where close to ours so I am pretty sure, I can scale this to immense figures. 

Now the facebook group where I posted the portfolio have closed the option of promotions, and I can't seem to approach clients or get any leads. I am exploring LinkedIn, Fiverr and other sites. but still I feel like there is something which I am missing or doing wrong. Now I know there are a lot of people with immense knowledge here, if you did read all of the above. Thankyou so so much, I feel proud that I was able to make even a single person read this. but if there is anything, any advice which you feel should be given to me, please do so. Where should I look at, where should I get the clients, should I start with Paid ads? What should I do right now, even if you have anything to say apart from this, please do so. Any critique or comment will be valuable to me more than you know. Again Thankyou so so much for reading this through. Hope you have a wonderful day ahead.

Nobody helped me out. 
I've dm'ed 100s of people seeking for help but they either don't reply or they try to sell me some course which are useless. 


But there are a few tips and strategies which consistently give good results and following them is a great way to get the IG algorithm work for you and I'd like to share my experience and mistakes with ya'll now that I'm consistently growing well. 

I'm usually packed with work but I'm completely free this weekend so I thought I'll help a few people out by sharing my experience on how to grow on IG. 

I'm doing this hoping that the people whom I help might help out a few others in future because nobody helped me out when I needed it.

Hello there.

My wife had a problem in business life. And woman obsessed my wife. I won't go into too much detail, i'll just tell about the instagram bug. A verified instagram account have a 52k followers. First step, 52k instagram account archiving all photo. Step two, 52k instagram account stole the target photos (the profile chosen by the person who paid for that page). Step three, 52k instagram account shared 'stolen photo' and step four, 52k instagram account report the target profile (account with few followers) and instagram algorithm deleted few followers account. 

My wife instagram account deleted yesterday. We contact instagram and we sending ID photo. They open my wife account. And then 52k instagram account stole again and deleted my wife account. Also 52k instagram account shared another people photo. This account always deleted peoples account in the same way. I reported this account but instagram didn't do anything about it. 

My wife's instagram account will be re-opened, we connection instagram again but 52k account will deleted again in the same way. How will this be prevented?

Just thinkin' i have a i don't know 80k account. Archiving my own photos, sharing my target photos, report few followers account and instagram deleted my target account. I think this is a big problem.

And she already said 'you'll see, i deleted your account'. I sued her she because she threatened my wife this is a not the problem, i handle it.

172,"Hi! As we all know, the Instagram algorithm changes quite often and so does the order of the people who watch your instagram story. I noticed recently that my ""best friends"" are no longer at the top in that list but rather the middle and my crush was number 1 (which he never was before). After the first 50 views, the order changes but he's still number one which is odd because we only dm'd 4 or 5 times in contrast with my friends who i talk to on Instagram on a daily basis. Now i read that it's actually based on my interactions with him but I only went on his Instagram a couple of times in the span of a longer period (so it's not like i check his Instagram daily or even weekly). He never was at the top, usually somewhere in the middle. My theory was that maybe he and the people at the top interact with my Instagram instead of it being me interacting with their profile? But that still doesn't seem logic because Instagram can't reveal such information no?

I am so sorry for not posting on here. Instagram has really been dropping my views, and as much as I know how to play the game this platform is really  hiding my stuff in the backround and I hate it. I started a tick tock, which first off, politics aside, is much better than  anything Facebook owned. I hate the algorithm Facebook has in place. It is only meant to show you as many ads as possible. And to prove that it's not my quality of content I have been posting the same content on tick tock as I am on here. I already have the same amount of followers that took me a year to get on here and I've only had a tick tock FOR A WEEK. It's almost impossible to make it on here and my views have dropped significantly. I have no idea if I have been shadow-banned because I use the same hashtags over and over (which I am now afraid of using ones like ""fairywings"" or ""potionbottle"" because I have used it too often even though that is literally what my product is and should be hashtagged as such) or if my views have dropped from the algorithm changing AGAIN. social media shouldn't have to be like chess, I shouldn't have to work THIS HARD to get just the people who follow me to see my stuff.

19,"Hello all, so I got the ""Your Instagram is Compromised"" message. I run an art instagram account. It is doing well. It currently has 315 followers in 2 weeks! And that is in no way by a bot or whatever (I didn't even know you could do that or there were bots to grow your Instagram). I post once a day around 11am to 3pm, nothing more. I get multiple comments, I reply to most of them. I get shared in stories, I share back. I do shout-outs for shout-outs, I DM people when we want collabs. That is the normal activities for an art account üôÇ. 

The only thing that I can think that is hurting my Instagram on my part atleast, is that it is shared between my boyfriend and I. I also was logged in on my laptop. We both own the account. So it was hooked up to 3 devices. Another thing is that we also like a ton of photos because we like other art accounts. We do not follow a large amount of people (about 50) and we never unfollow them. We keep that in check. I spend about 3hrs on Instagram, scrolling, liking, commenting and he does too. I've gotten TempBanned maybe 5 times for just liking. He has never gotten TempBanned but he also got the ""Your Instagram is Compromised"" message on his device. 
I can maybe see why Instagram probably thinks there is a bot involved because things are happening very fast. But there isn't a bot involved whatsoever (of course..). 

So, we did get our account back around 2am today (it was Compromised at 1:43am) and I've only replied to a DM this morning (a collab idea). I haven't liked a photo, or liked a comment. I have logged out on my computer completely and will not log back in unless it is urgent. I plan to post today around the same time also. I am beginning to unlike instagram with each update, I cannot be the only one. I am not on there a ton unless it is my art account that we soon want to turn into a business. We practice kindness and spread joy through 2 cute animal characters, so we're not posting anything terrible or Mature at all. 

We prefer to post once a day to keep our followers and we want to keep our engagement up because that is what Social Media is. We're supposed to be social, however, Instagram's algorithm isn't that friendly. And ever since Facebook bought instagram, I've seen some things I absolutely hate. Reels for an example, is one of them. Anyways, I know this is a bunch and no one will read it, but I am worried about our account possibly being banned for weeks, months?? All the cute articles online say we won't get banned but I go to Reddit/Twitter and people are begging for their account back with absolutely no response because Instagram is hard to get to (speaking of which does anyone know who I can talk to from instagram that will reply?).

37,"Greetings all! 

Today, I'd like to share with you all my (frustrating) experience in building a social media following. I write to you about this cause I dont see all that many posts about one's experience in this and I thought this might be useful for aspiring artists - learn from my mistakes.

I started posting digital art under the name ""Haltab"" in 2017 on DeviantArt. I'd say that skill-wise, I am mediocre. However, I think I am good enough to consistently attract new followers (at least in theory). In other words, I'm not good enough to be called ""good"" by myself or anyone who knows alot about digital art, but good enough to attract followers on social media. Y'know - mediocre. 

Because of this, I assumed that gaining a following would be a breeze. 

It was not. 

DeviantArt has had a rough couple of years, mainly due to the DA team not being able to keep up with other social media. It wasnt until 2019 that they updated their UI to something resembling ""post-2003 internet"". Back in the early 2000's, DA was THE place for artists online. However, they've been dethroned pretty harshly in the recent decades and the masses have to a large extend left the site for Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr (before 18+ content was nuked), ArtStation, etc. So when I joined DA in 2017, it was diffucult to grow, let alone being seen by more than 5 people at all. 

(DA might still be able to recover, now with their new UI, but that all depends on if the DA team cares enough about their site to actually market it and attract the masses .... but I digress) 

In short, my experience trying to grow an audience on DA is a huge disappointment and a massive waste of time. I think, after 3 years, I have maybe 50-100 legitimate followers (if you visit my DA profile, you will see over 1 000 followers, but most of those are just bots that came from a scam service on DA - ironically popular service actually). DA is not a dead site, but it is certainly struggling. And as a result, any artist that will establish themselves on the site in 2020 or later, will probably struggle aswell. The few artists that are doing well on DA are those with a huge pre-built following, or those creating porn. It's quite sad.

I've tried other social media sites aswell, namely Tumblr, ArtStation and Imgur. Tumblr didn't work out because, well, A) because I didnt like the political-echo-chamber-culture on Tumblr, and B) everyone left when the porn was banned. And when it comes to ArtStation, well - I'm not good enough to compete with the artists on ArtStation. ArtStation is very much a site dedicated to the 1% best illustrators, modelers, designers out there. The guys that work for Riot, ILM, etc., are the guys you find on ArtStation. On Imgur I rarely got past user-sub (user-submitted / new posts). In usersub there are people who seemingly dedicate their lives to downvoting everything. I dont even know, man :P

I tried my hand at TikTok. In my early days on TikTok (december 2019) I tried posting my art. Luke-warm response at best. 900 followers over a 3-month period. Then I tried a special kind of russia meme (for the hell of it) like those made by the TikTok user Juccy2 (If i recall correctly), and I blew up. Multiple videos with many millions of views. And mind you, all I did was creating the exact same russia meme over and over again, just with different pop culture characters. People ate it up. Ended up with 91k followers in a couple weeks. I thought I'd take advantage of my TikTok fame and channel it into my art. I deleted all videos, and started posting art videos of a much higher quality than both my original art videos and my russia memes. The response to these new videos were not millions of views. No, barely a couple hundred. At the time of writing this, most of them have around 300 views each. These new videos are the ones you can still see on my TikTok. They're by far the best-quality TikToks I've ever made, but also the least popular. I didnt gain any followers, I merely lost a couple thousand. People didnt want art, they want russia memes. ...Even if its the same god damn joke over and over and over and over again. 

So that brings us to the main dish of this post, and what I really wanted to talk about; Instagram. More specifically, being an unknown artist on Instagram, and having to deal with the Instagram algorithm. 

My first post on IG was in april 2018, and today I have 46 posts (each post being a finished artwork), and 2600 followers. Dont get excited by those two thousand, tho. Most of those followers do not come from people organically finding my artwork on IG, they mainly come from 400 dollars worth of IG ads, personal friends and family, and people coming from my TikTok expecting me to post russia memes. No, I'm not joking.

I joined IG in 2018. I joined late. I joined IG when all the big artists were established and already had tens of thousands of followers. I joined IG when you need to get 3 000+ likes on a post within the first hour of you posting it, in order for the IG algorithm to deem your post worthy enough to be placed at the top of an art-related hashtag. I joined IG when you can only grow by already having a huge amount of followers who will like your post fast enough to have it reach the explore page and thus gain the ability to be seen by potential new followers. I joined IG when people's feeds are bombarded with multi-million-follower-meme-accounts that post multiple meme-posts per hour, every hour, every day, all year long.

I joined IG when the IG-artist-market had entered in it's own version of late stage capitalism.

When asked about how to grow on IG, people say things like ""Post every day"" but also things like ""You need to make sure that you only post high quality posts, and that you have an aesthetically pleasing IG feed"". When I hear things like this, I think ""Well okay then, which is it? Quantity or quality?"" I personally decided on quality (as best as I can manage). Each one of my IG posts represents one finished artwork. It's the best solution in my opinion. However, its pretty hard to ""post every day"" when each painting takes around 12-20 hours of work and you are a full-time student, have a social life, and responsibilities. 

I'll be completely honest here; If you went up to me and asked me ""Haltab, with your three years of experience, how do I grow a social media following for my art in 2020?"" - I honestly wouldnt know what to tell you. I'd probably say ""Either already be a famous person and take your preexisting audience to IG, or make soft-core porn of pop culture characters, or pray to all the seven circles of Hell that you somehow go viral"".

Because honest to God, I have no clue how to grow a following within the current social media market. 

Here's a tangent for you that should paint a picture. I once saw a YouTube video from one of these social media marketing gurus titled ""How to get 10 000 followers in 5 hours"" or something like that. I dont remember the specifics.. but anyways. In the video, the person set up a new IG account, found a niche (skateboarding, I think) and posted 3 posts of people skateboarding. THEN, HE LEGIT OPENED UP A SEPARATE ACCOUNT HE OWNED, WITH 2 MILLION FOLLOWERS, and made a bunch of posts on that account that were all designed to make his 2 million followers follow this new skating account. Then he waited for 5 hours, showed off his results - 10k followers, and ended the video. Yep.

\---

A counter-arguement to my frustration that I've thought about is ""Oh, little Haltab, the reason you dont grow is not because of IG late stage capitalism, it's just because you fucking suck at art"". And I honestly think that this is atleast partially true. However, I also cant shake the feeling that there are other factors at play aswell. For example, I constantly see less experienced artists gain much more attention on social media than I ever do, and I wonder if there is something they're doing better than me other than raw rendering skill. Likewise I often see artists who are WAAAAAAY better than me get less attention than even I do. Off the top of my head I can name two examples right now - OliverBeck (on DA) and MazertYoung (on DA). These guys are criminally underrated! Their art is absolutely stunning, yet they get very little attention. ...Why?

(Side note, check out MazertYoung's Genji fan art - it is literally the coolest Genji fan art I've ever seen). 

So to sum all this up, I guess I should say that I know very little. I know what not to do? I guess...? Or? Honestly, I dont know. At the very least this post should be a fun little read into my disappointing social media growth lol.

For example, I constantly see less experienced artists gain much more attention on social media than I ever do, and I wonder if there is something they're doing better than me other than raw rendering skill. Likewise I often see artists who are WAAAAAAY better than me get less attention than even I do. Off the top of my head I can name two examples right now - OliverBeck (on DA) and MazertYoung (on DA). These guys are criminally underrated! Their art is absolutely stunning, yet they get very little attention. ...Why?

(Side note, check out MazertYoung's Genji fan art - it is literally the coolest Genji fan art I've ever seen). 

So to sum all this up, I guess I should say that I know very little. I know what not to do? I guess...? Or? Honestly, I dont know. At the very least this post should be a fun little read into my disappointing social media growth lol.

TL;DR - I suck at social media :P",,ArtistLounge,"""instagram algorithm""",1596490163,My 3-year experience building a social media following for my art; a rant.,2020-08-03 21:29:23,,,

4. It is your responsibility to privately notify me, by sending a screen shot of likes/comments on your recent post, of who is missing from the group.

194,"Hi All,

I run a music/art Instagram page where I promote submissions and just stuff that I think is cool and other people will appreciate. The page was relatively successful amassing 16K followers with videos receiving 1000+ views and a large number of likes.  

However, over the last couple of months, my reach has fallen drastically, and I'll be lucky if I even get 100 views on my videos. I had stopped posting for a while, and my followers have fallen to 13K, but I decided to reboot the Instagram account and have been working over the last month to curate photos and videos and have 100 posts ready for the next 100 days.  However, when I look at my recent posts, my insights my videos barely reach 300+ people (Barely 2% of my total following), and this is very frustrating.

**I tried the following things.** 

1. Going in a new direction and started adding photography to my Instagram -  this seems to have some improvements but hasn't done much.
2. Liking and commenting on more users works to show that I am active to the Instagram algorithm.
3. Started maintaining a red theme throughout my posts so that it looks more attractive on the main profile page.
4. Removed all banned hashtags from my previous posts 

**I'm thinking of doing the following things.**

1. Remove my **mass followers** \- that is my followers that follow more than 5000 people as it is unlikely that my posts will reach them, however, doing so will remove 7,000 of my followers bringing me down to 6,000 followers.
2. Starting a completely new Instagram account as I have previously used programs such as followliker but soon stopped that once I thought it was actually detrimental to pursue such a strategy. Perhaps doing so permanently flagged my account to Instagram as spam?

*It takes a lot of work to curate the photos and music, and I honestly am starting to think that It might not be worth it anymore and am seriously considering deleting the page altogether.*

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! here's a link to my Instagram page that I am referring to.***\[rubyroom.label\]***

I am an artist, and am trying to work with / on Instagram.

As a content creator I have four ""fields of experience"", which I share below.

‚Äã

-&gt; About Ig-offered promotion:

I tried out Ig-promotion and wondered why Ig ""Insights"" didn't count ""likes"" or ""reach"" gained via promotion as likes or reach.

I found that the ""likes"" gained via promotion are omitted from Ig Insights statistics.

Does Instagram classify its own promotion as what? ""Not organic""?

‚Äã

-&gt; About all that cheating:

What discourages me a bit is that people ""following-unfollowing"" others gain success, and the trustful not-cheating people are punished.

It seems to me that the current Instagram policy boosts dishonest behavior.

What ""community"" would teach its members to use dishonest behavior?

I see, that:""The lie made into the rule of the world.‚Äù (Kafka ""The Trial"").

‚Äã

-&gt; About ""vanishing hashtag visibility"":

So not wanting to cheat my followers, I saw my only chance to get new followers without cheating in using hashtags more intensively.

It didn't help, the contrary happened!

The result was that I lost more and more visibility through some automated visibility degradation, actual punishment.

For me it felt like China seemed to host the Ig servers and algorithms.

My experience is: I never do know why I am punished, and what for. I am like a dog kicked and not knowing what for.

No response to my questions typed into ""Report a problem"" came back, no reaction.

An invisible court seems to judge me.

Franz Kafka seems to write the Instagram diary: ‚ÄúJudgement does not come suddenly; the proceedings gradually merge into the judgement.‚Äù (Kafka ""The Trial"").

‚Äã

-&gt; And finally: I suffer hashtag filtering for harmless abstract drawings.

Abstract drawings showing ""nothing"" - at least nothing recognizable - get filtered and disappear from every hashtag search.

The Instagram Algortihm ""sees things"". (""Judgement..."")

‚Äã

To sum it up: Cheating rewards, invisibility bans, no responses of the ""algorithmic judges"", no human responses, no responses at all.

‚Äã

I like the Instagram visuals.

But my user experience as a content creator is currently an IMMENSELY frustating one.

‚Äã

My suggestions for improvement of ""The Instagram Algorithm"" are:

‚Äã

(1) Prevent ""follow-unfollow"" cheating, reward fairness.

(2) Loosen filters for artists.

(3) Explain penalties, be transparent. Omit hidden algorithmic punishments.

(4) Explain payed marketing / promotion. Tell your customers what value they get back.",sensemaking,Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",1594767450,"BAN THE ARTIST: how content creators might get frustrated by ""The Algorithm"" - AND KAFKA",2020-07-14 22:57:30,problem,problem,sensemaking

Before the update, I felt like I had a pretty solid grasp on what the algorithm rewarded and punished, so I was getting solid reach on my posts. Since the update, my reach has halved. I have spoken to several other people who have had the same experience. I am wondering if there are any resources people could recommend where people put up information on algorithm updates. Most of what I learned about the previous version of the algorithm was trial and error and to be honest, that takes time that I would rather spend creating content then letting it flop. I looked for subreddits and didn‚Äôt find any and I haven‚Äôt found a solid internet source, so any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",problem,socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",1594694332,Instagram Algorithm Resources,2020-07-14 2:38:52,problem,problem,problem

Yes I know I know, nobody knows how it works. I dont think even the developers know how it works lol.

Currently I have around 950 followers, I get around 1200-1500 reach with decent photos and 3000-4000 with popular ones which is pretty good for that follower count. I get around 200 to 400 likes.  


I havent posted nothing for like a month, yesterday I posted a picture and I expected to get super bad reach (IG basically punishing me for not being active) which did happen and I got like 90 likes.  


BUT suddenly, after like 14-15 hours, I was getting a huge wave of likes, so I go check the hashtags and I am in ""popular"" almost on every hashtag so I am like ""wtf just happened"" - dont you have to post a picture that gets engaged a lot to get in popular ? And how the hell do they put you in popular after 15 hours, its so random.

He told if someone likes your content they might like it, engage with it via comments or might even share the content to his/her friend circle.

But if someone really finds actually value in your post, they are going to save it for future reference.

This reflects on Instagram's algorithm too. It takes into account whether the ratio of saves your post get is high or low and pushes your content realising that it is of real value if it is being saved by many.

After that, I have been focusing on that feature more.

Well this is what I would like to call Instagram Account genetics, but what is this?

Let's talk a bit about ‚ÄúGenetics‚Äù from the biological aspect as it will help you get a crystal clear understanding of what I mean by Instagram Account Genetics.

Remember when you were taught that genes are how ‚Äútraits‚Äù are passed from your parents to you, this means:

‚Äî if your parents are tall then you or a few of your siblings will be tall (*wasn't the best in biology class but this is how I remember it*)

‚Äî If your mum has blue eyes then there's a chance one of your siblings will have blue eyes

Genes are why some people (maybe you) have dimples and I don't, why body building may be easier for you but not for me.

And Genes are why you know biology than I do (*not sure about this one, guess I wasn't just paying attention in class*).

So now let's discuss Instagram genetics and Instagram genetic engineering (how to modify your account's performance to reach your goals).


Every Instagram account is created different, there's a common myth that aged new accounts are better to grow than totally new ones, there's another myth that phone number verified accounts will get less ‚Äúaction blocks‚Äù than just normal email verified ones.

Well, these are myths because you may get different results when you test but it completely makes sense because Instagram trusts older and number verified accounts.

So we've talked about how verifying or not verifying your account can affect your account's performance long-term, cool.


All Instagram accounts come blank, just as we come as innocent babies and our experiences and the people we meet make us who we are, now you need to understand that if you are poorly malnourished you may not be tall even if you have the tendency to, so we can agree your environment plays an important role in your development, and it's the same for Instagram accounts.


How? Why? How do you create the perfect environment/experience for your Instagram account? And how do you change the genetics of your account?

Well, it's simple but there are 3 key things you need to understand, and they are:

üëâ Instagram is a content based platform and the type (not quality) is as important as the quality of content you post.

*don't get confused, we'll revisit this.*

üëâ Instagram is a momentum based platform

üëâ Instagram is a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù media platform and the platform was created so people can interact with each other's content

Cool, we've got the 3 Basics out of the way but how do you use these to create the type of account you want?

Let's discuss that


‚úãüèº Instagram As A Content Based Platform

Instagram was created so people can share ‚Äúvisual‚Äù content with each other, now there are 2 main types of visual content on Instagram, and these are videos and images


BUT, both types of visual content can be shared in different ways such as:


‚úî Posts (on feed)

‚úî Carousels

‚úî Stories

‚úî IGTV

Each content type has the ability to do well in the distribution channel that fit its.

‚ú® Accounts with more videos go viral easily on explore and ‚Äúother‚Äù (depends on niche also).

‚ú® Accounts with more images go viral on the hashtags section easily

‚ú® Carousels do better on explore

Now that you know this, how does this help you?

It's obvious, if you want to genetically engineer your account to go viral on the explore page then post more videos and carousels, if you want to go viral on hashtags then post more images.

Quality content + winning content type = Viral üî•

NOTE: Other factors can affect this process, if you select poor hashtags then you can't say ‚Äúmy account isn't built for hashtags‚Äù because that's your mistake.


‚úãüèº Instagram as a Momentum Based Platform

You may have heard a lot of people saying ‚Äúpost quality content‚Äù, that's true, but the part most people miss is quality content gets you nowhere without consistency just like everything in life.

Do you expect to get in shape when you only visit the gym ‚Äúwhen you feel like it?‚Äù

Do you? Do you? (*waiting for an answer*)

Consistent quality content is important for the growth of every account as the momentum builds slowly.

You may not see any immediate changes but the change will come.

So how do you use this to your advantage?

It's simple, have a posting schedule and post 3 or more times daily

‚Äú3 or more times? Isn't that too much?‚Äù

I know that's what you're thinking *but after months of living in my office, living of just chips, a lot of canned drinks that'll probably end me with diabetes, and plotting growth graphs trying to understand the algorithm* I can finally tell you posting 3 or more times daily is the best consistent posting strategy.

Why?

When you post once, Instagram shows your content to a few of your followers, post again and your content reaches other followers who didn't see the first post, do that the 3rd time and your posts gets seen by 3 times more people who would've seen one post.

Only the people who interact with your post will see it the next time, so posting more and getting more engagement means your posts will get shown to more of your followers.


*And err I didn't plot growth graphs, might have exaggerated there*





‚úãüèº Instagram as a ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù media platform


Instagram was created to be a distraction that enables people spend hours on the platform thereby seeing more ads and making Mark rich enough to fund world domination, sounds üò≤ but that's what all social media platforms were created for (maybe not all)


Now, there are two ways to make Mark rich, you either:

üëâ Spend time on the platform

or

üëâ Advertise on the platform

Mark's bots love people who make him rich, and his bots hate people who want to get rich from the platform without making their boss rich (y'all need to protect me if Mark sees this and comes for me).

So if you don't advertise then you need to engage, you need to give to get, and this is where account ‚Äútraining‚Äù comes into play.



What is Engagement Training and How Do You Do It?


Engagement training is a process in which you intentionally spend time engaging with the content of other's so your account can be categorized properly by the Instagram Algorithm.

If I create a new account and I'm just posting my own stuff the algorithm will think ‚Äúoh! He's a spammer, and he won't make our boss money so let's reduce his reach‚Äù.

When you create a new account, for the first few weeks follow some people and like their posts, then spend most of your time engaging with content in your niche.

Instagram won't know what my account is about if I'm posting cats and engaging with supercar content on my explore feed.

You'll know your account has been categorized correctly if you begin to see stuff related to what you post on the explore page.

NOTES:

‚Äî Do you want your account to go viral on explore and ‚Äúother‚Äù? Engage with more content from the explore page!

‚Äî Do you want your posts to be shown to your followers? Engage with the posts of your followers!

‚Äî Want to appear on hashtags? Follow more hashtags.



Going Viral On Instagram Stories By Training Your Account To Go Viral On Stories


We've discussed how Instagram is a momentum based platform, content platform, social platform, and how to ‚Äútrain‚Äù your account for engagement.

BUT before we begin you need to understand why it's possible to go viral on stories.

The Instagram story is a content sharing section they decided to create, so they can sell more ads, it used to be impossible to go viral on stories until they included stories as a part of the ‚Äúexplore page‚Äù.

Yes it's easy to hit the explore page with stories, but it will get more difficult just like how we've been experiencing a decline in the home ‚Äúfeed‚Äù.


Now let's implement this to make your stories go viral without hashtags or location tagging.


üëâ Start uploading a lot of stories daily, 10 or more.

üëâ Keep doing that for weeks (you should begin to see results after 3 weeks)

üëâ Watch the stories of the people you follow consistently

üî• Go viral


Is it that simple? Yes, but it takes dedication.

Here's a case study of how I started getting over 10k story views daily with a new 700+ follower account:

‚è≥ Week 1: 10 stories daily ‚Äî Nothing happened just a few views from my followers (100 followers then)

‚è≥ Week 2: 10 stories or more daily ‚Äî Result as first week

‚è≥ Week 3: 10 stories or more daily ‚Äî Each story started getting a minimum of 1k views

‚è≥ End of week 3: First 10k view story (300 followers on the account)


‚è≥ Week 4: First 50k story views, all stories doing a minimum of 10k views daily (still uploading 10 daily)


‚è≥ Week 5: Decline in views for 3 days (normal)

‚è≥ Week 5: Stories back up to 4k daily views (still 700 follower account)

üëâ Check my profile for Screenshots of beginning and end of week 3 (this sub doesn't allow links or images)

Can you replicate this for your new account? Yes!

Can you replicate this on an old account? Yes, but it will be more difficult to do.

Can you replicate this on IGTV? Yes, same basic rules apply.


My next test will be training an account to go viral on IGTV, and yeah there'll be lots of screenshots next time.


What Type Of Account Should You Build To Grow Faster?

Modifying the genetics of your account is cool, but what type of account should you build? What should you focus on?

Focus on training your account to go viral on stories, the explore page, and ‚Äúother‚Äù.

BUT why? Here's why you shouldn't pay attention to hashtags and why they're not my favourite.

üöÄ The Explore Page Benefits:

üöÄ High conversion rate

üöÄ More profile visits

üöÄ More reach


üõ©‚ÄúOther‚Äù Benefits

üõ© Reach is in millions

üõ© High conversion rate

üõ© More profile visits


üõ∂ Hashtag Disadvantages

üõ∂ Reach is capped at thousands, hitting a million from this source is extremely difficult

üõ∂ Poor conversion rate

üõ∂ Low profile visits


As I've shown above, the Explore page is like a rocket, it gives you the chance to reach millions of people and these people can click to your profile easily and follow you.

‚ÄúOther‚Äù is when your posts gets a lot of shares, this is any impression that doesn't come from the explore page or hashtag.

Other is like a Jet, a viral post will reach millions of people and most will become followers.

Hashtags are not wonderful, this can be compared to a boat, you'll reach a decent number of people but the follower conversion is super low as the format for viral posts makes it difficult for the user to click to your profile.

It's also hard to reach millions of people from hashtags because only 5% of the people who follow a hashtag are actually active on that hashtag.


Can your account go viral on all? Just like humans no one has it all, your account can't reach a million people on hashtags, a million people on explore, and a million from ‚Äúother‚Äù that's why you'll often see one performing poorly while the others do great.

Modifying the genetics of your account is cool, but what type of account should you build? What should you focus on?

Focus on training your account to go viral on stories, the explore page, and ‚Äúother‚Äù.

BUT why? Here's why you shouldn't pay attention to hashtags and why they're not my favourite.

üöÄ The Explore Page Benefits:

üöÄ High conversion rate

üöÄ More profile visits

üöÄ More reach


üõ©‚ÄúOther‚Äù Benefits

üõ© Reach is in millions

üõ© High conversion rate

üõ© More profile visits


üõ∂ Hashtag Disadvantages

üõ∂ Reach is capped at thousands, hitting a million from this source is extremely difficult

üõ∂ Poor conversion rate

üõ∂ Low profile visits


As I've shown above, the Explore page is like a rocket, it gives you the chance to reach millions of people and these people can click to your profile easily and follow you.

‚ÄúOther‚Äù is when your posts gets a lot of shares, this is any impression that doesn't come from the explore page or hashtag.

Other is like a Jet, a viral post will reach millions of people and most will become followers.

Hashtags are not wonderful, this can be compared to a boat, you'll reach a decent number of people but the follower conversion is super low as the format for viral posts makes it difficult for the user to click to your profile.

It's also hard to reach millions of people from hashtags because only 5% of the people who follow a hashtag are actually active on that hashtag.


Can your account go viral on all? Just like humans no one has it all, your account can't reach a million people on hashtags, a million people on explore, and a million from ‚Äúother‚Äù, and that's why you'll often see one performing poorly while the others do great.

277,"Yes you read the title of this post correctly, and yes all Instagram accounts are not created equal because there's something different about all accounts and their potential to go viral, now what is ‚Äúsomething different‚Äù?


Well this is what I would like to call Instagram Account genetics, but what is this?

Let's talk a bit about ‚ÄúGenetics‚Äù from the biological aspect as it will help you get a crystal clear understanding of what I mean by Instagram Account Genetics.

Remember when you were taught that genes are how ‚Äútraits‚Äù are passed from your parents to you, this means:

‚Äî if your parents are tall then you or a few of your siblings will be tall (*wasn't the best in biology class but this is how I remember it*)

‚Äî If your mum has blue eyes then there's a chance one of your siblings will have blue eyes

Genes are why some people (maybe you) have dimples and I don't, why body building may be easier for you but not for me.

And Genes are why you know biology than I do (*not sure about this one, guess I wasn't just paying attention in class*).

So now let's discuss Instagram genetics and Instagram genetic engineering (how to modify your account's performance to reach your goals).


Every Instagram account is created different, there's a common myth that aged new accounts are better to grow than totally new ones, there's another myth that phone number verified accounts will get less ‚Äúaction blocks‚Äù than just normal email verified ones.

Well, these are myths because you may get different results when you test but it completely makes sense because Instagram trusts older and number verified accounts.

So we've talked about how verifying or not verifying your account can affect your account's performance long-term, cool.


All Instagram accounts come blank, just as we come as innocent babies and our experiences and the people we meet make us who we are, now you need to understand that if you are poorly malnourished you may not be tall even if you have the tendency to, so we can agree your environment plays an important role in your development, and it's the same for Instagram accounts.


How? Why? How do you create the perfect environment/experience for your Instagram account? And how do you change the genetics of your account?

Well, it's simple but there are 3 key things you need to understand, and they are:

üëâ Instagram is a content based platform and the type (not quality) is as important as the quality of the content you post.

*don't get confused, we'll revisit this.*

üëâ Instagram is a momentum based platform

üëâ Instagram is a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù media platform,and the platform was created so people can interact with each other's content

Cool, we've got the 3 Basics out of the way but how do you use these to create the type of account you want?

Let's discuss that


‚úãüèº Instagram As A Content Based Platform

Instagram was created so people can share ‚Äúvisual‚Äù content with each other, now there are 2 main types of visual content on Instagram, and these are videos and images


BUT, both types of visual content can be shared in different ways such as:


‚úî Posts (on feed)

‚úî Carousels

‚úî Stories

‚úî IGTV

Each content type has the ability to do well in the distribution channel that fits it.

‚ú® Accounts with more videos go viral easily on explore and ‚Äúother‚Äù (depends on niche also).

‚ú® Accounts with more images go viral on the hashtags section easily

‚ú® Carousels do better on explore

Now that you know this, how does this help you?

It's obvious, if you want to genetically engineer your account to go viral on the explore page then post more videos and carousels, if you want to go viral on hashtags then post more images.

Quality content + winning content type = Viral üî•

NOTE: Other factors can affect this process, if you select poor hashtags then you can't say ‚Äúmy account isn't built for hashtags‚Äù because that's your mistake.


‚úãüèº Instagram as a Momentum Based Platform

You may have heard a lot of people saying ‚Äúpost quality content‚Äù, that's true, but the part most people miss is quality content gets you nowhere without consistency just like everything in life.

Do you expect to get in shape when you only visit the gym ‚Äúwhen you feel like it?‚Äù

Do you? Do you? (*waiting for an answer*)

Consistent quality content is important for the growth of every account as the momentum builds slowly.

You may not see any immediate changes but the change will come.

So how do you use this to your advantage?

It's simple, have a posting schedule and post 3 or more times daily

‚Äú3 or more times? Isn't that too much?‚Äù

I know that's what you're thinking *but after months of living in my office, living of chips, a lot of canned drinks that'll probably end me with diabetes, and plotting growth graphs trying to understand the algorithm* I can finally tell you posting 3 or more times daily is the best consistent posting strategy.

Why?

When you post once, Instagram shows your content to a few of your followers, post again and your content reaches other followers who didn't see the first post, do that the 3rd time and your posts gets seen by 3 times more people who would've seen one post.

Only the people who interact with your post will see it the next time, so posting more and getting more engagement means your posts will get shown to more of your followers.


*And err I didn't plot growth graphs, might have exaggerated there*



‚úãüèº Instagram as a ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù media platform


Instagram was created to be a distraction that makes people spend hours on the platform thereby seeing more ads and making Mark rich enough to fund world domination, sounds üò≤ but that's what all social media platforms were created for (maybe not all)


Now, there are two ways to make Mark rich, you either:

üëâ Spend time on the platform

or

üëâ Advertise on the platform

Mark's bots love people who make him rich, and his bots hate people who want to get rich from the platform without making their boss rich (y'all need to protect me if Mark sees this and comes for me).

So if you don't advertise then you need to engage, you need to give to get, and this is where account ‚Äútraining‚Äù comes into play.



What is Engagement Training and How Do You Do It?


Engagement training is a process in which you intentionally spend time engaging with the content of other's so your account can be categorized properly by the Instagram Algorithm.

If I create a new account and I'm just posting my own stuff the algorithm will think ‚Äúoh! He's a spammer, and he won't make our boss money so let's reduce his reach‚Äù.

When you create a new account, for the first few weeks follow some people and like their posts, then spend most of your time engaging with content in your niche.

Instagram won't know what my account is about if I'm posting cats and engaging with supercar content on my explore feed.

You'll know your account has been categorized correctly if you begin to see stuff related to what you post on the explore page.

NOTES:

‚Äî Do you want your account to go viral on explore and ‚Äúother‚Äù? Engage with more content from the explore page!

‚Äî Do you want your posts to be shown to your followers? Engage with the posts of your followers!

‚Äî Want to appear on hashtags? Follow more hashtags.



üî•Going Viral On Instagram Stories By Training Your Account To Go Viral On Stories


We've discussed how Instagram is a momentum based platform, content platform, social platform, and how to ‚Äútrain‚Äù your account for engagement.

BUT before we begin you need to understand why it's possible to go viral on stories.

The Instagram story is a content sharing section they decided to create, so they can sell more ads, it used to be impossible to go viral on stories until they included stories as a part of the ‚Äúexplore page‚Äù.

Yes it's easy to hit the explore page with stories, but it will get more difficult just like how we've been experiencing a decline in the home ‚Äúfeed‚Äù.


Now let's implement this to make your stories go viral without hashtags or location tagging.


üëâ Start uploading a lot of stories daily, 10 or more.

üëâ Keep doing that for weeks (you should begin to see results after 3 weeks)

üëâ Watch the stories of the people you follow consistently

üî• Go viral


Is it that simple? Yes, but it takes dedication.

Here's a case study of how I started getting over 10k story views daily with a new 700+ follower account:

‚è≥ Week 1: 10 stories daily ‚Äî Nothing happened just a few views from my followers (100 followers then)

‚è≥ Week 2: 10 stories or more daily ‚Äî Result as first week

‚è≥ Week 3: 10 stories or more daily ‚Äî Each story started getting a minimum of 1k views

‚è≥ End of week 3: First 10k story views (300 followers on the account)


‚è≥ Week 4: First 50k story views, all stories doing a minimum of 10k views daily (still uploading 10 daily)


‚è≥ Week 5: Decline in views for 3 days (normal)

‚è≥ Week 5: Stories back up to 4k daily views (still 700 follower account)

üëâ [Screenshots of begining and end of week 3](https://imgur.com/a/N8pGhje)

Can you replicate this for your new account? Yes!

Can you replicate this on an old account? Yes, but it will be more difficult to do.

Can you replicate this on IGTV? Yes, same basic rules apply.

Hi !

My Instagram account has been disabled in January, and I was told it lasted three months until someone real would check it.

I still have NO information (no formal email, no warning, nothing...) about it and I'm wondering how I can get it back since they do not respond to my emails and I can't contact them on their Facebook page...

I think the reason my account has been disabled is the joke I wrote in my bio : ""Nudes are overrated, send me money instead"". And I guess, the Instagram algorithm only saw ""send nudes"" and ""money"" in the same sentence assuming I was selling nudes... x.x I mean, an English speaker would have understood the joke...

Anyway, does anyone have some information that could help me ?

I lost a lot of wonderful art accounts I was following but also friends I made online on Instagram. Plus, my account really respected every rule of Instagram's chart therefore it's really unfair in my opinion...","problem, sensemaking",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",1586776991,Disabled IG account,2020-04-13 11:23:11,problem,problem,problem

* World-class photos were selected once or twice a day. Each photo usually had either hundreds, or thousands of likes on their original posts.
* The original poster's tags were used for each photo. If the tags were buried under hundreds of comments new tags were created ranging from 500K to 26M followers
* No like-for-like, or follow-for-follow interactions took place. The account was left alone on the merit of photo quality and hashtag reach.

Result.

* The account is simply dead if left alone. 
* It has gathered an audience of 50 in the course of three months. (Feature accounts with world class photos usually sport an audience of 100K or more)
* Only ONE photo (the Charlize Theron photo) got into hashtag ""turbo"" mode. This is when the Instagram algorithm bumps the photo up into the hashtag stream and the photo keeps floating and appears near the top while newer photos stream by. 
* There is a ""chicken and egg"" situation where a vast number of followers (at least 1000) is needed to generate the initial likes and cause the Instagram algorithms to value a photo enough to give it hashtag ""turbo"" status.

At this point I am inclined to conclude that with world-class quality and hashtags alone a new account will not go far on Instagram. Other strategies are needed to obtain ""reach"".

# üì∑1. Cross-promote your dedicated hashtag.¬†

That's nice that you created a #joesgarage hashtag for your company, but who knows to use it to share content about you? Make sure it's in your profile, but take the game offline and have it printed on your receipts, in print ads, on signage in your store and at relevant events.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](z3bt86d19wf41)

If you're on radio and TV, direct people to use your hashtag. Integrate online and offline campaigns by ensuring it's listed on your other social profiles, on your website, and in your email blasts. Don't just hope people will find it.

# 2.¬† Get creative with hashtagging.

When it comes to [Instagram](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/06/13/instagram-algorithm) caption ideas, you need to look beyond the one-word, obvious [hashtags](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/05/29/instagram-hashtags). Sure, you want to use those, too, but mix it up and use hashtags to tell part of your story. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous--just don't be BORING. Collaborative workspace company¬†[WeWork¬†](https://www.instagram.com/wework/)is great at this, and they include a fun mix of Instagram content, too.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](lgrk99d99wf41)

# 3. ¬†Participate in massively popular conversations.¬†

For every post, use a mix of topically relevant hashtags such as #woodworking for a carpentry company, for example, as well as trending, super-popular hashtags wherever you can.

The really specific hashtags are like long-tail keywords in that they show more intent and help you find the right people, but the universally trending hashtags like #instagood, #tbt, #photooftheday or even plain old #fun¬†get you in front of more people¬†in general. You need both to make it on a social network as big and noisy as Instagram.

# 4. Getting followers with groups

there are a lot of groups that they can help you to get the quantity of followers that you want only by a few dollars .

57,"Hi all,

Lately I‚Äôve been trying to help my wife that is a graphic designer and illustrator to growth her IG page, these are some conclusions I got: 

Instagram as Facebook is a closed network system, it prioritizes to show your content to people follows you assuming they are your friends.

By observation it seems that the algorithm want people account to be at even level about following and followed, some degree of variation is expected but the system aims to make you have the same amount of people following you, so if you follow more people system will boost your exposure to make you gain followers(?)

Good hashtags represent 70% of overall impressions in relation to the amount of people follows you, so if there are 100 active accounts your post has been shared (on home), it‚Äôs expected that 230 additional impressions come from the hashtags, so the more followers you have more reach the hashtags will have (?)

What are your experiences with IG account growth?

I am not an Instagram user (asking for a friend).

\---

1. Is it true that Instagram algorithms promote more ""fresh"" photos?

My friend has heard or read somewhere that the Instagram algorithm prefers photos that were made today and posted today, rather than photos that were made a week ago and posted today. Is it true?

\---

2. How does the Instagram algorithm react if certain EXIF data are changed manually?

Does the algorithm recognize such a photo as fresh or not? Or maybe the algorithm recognizes that EXIF data has been changed and marks the photo (or account) as suspicious?

\---

3. How does Instagram algorithm react to photos without any EXIF data?

How does he promote them? Like old/new/suspicious, etc.?

When it comes to using hashtags vs not using hashtags, there is no argument. Hashtags on Instagram will *always* get more eyes on your content. For those of us who have been using hashtags on Instagram already, we know that using them and using them to their full potential are two different things. Maybe you are getting into tracking the post count of each hashtags as well as the number of likes for the best content. You might even be using a ""hashtag ladder"" strategy to boost yourself into the Top Posts for certain hashtags.

Let's take it to the next level. If we dive into a little bit of psychology and study how people use hashtags *as a user* of Instagram we can precisely pick hashtags to yield the specific results we desire. For now we will focus on the hashtags for comments. The hashtags that we use don't only put our content in certain feeds but they can provoke action from the viewers. Better yet, the people browsing certain hashtags on Instagram are already prewired to be more inclined to make a comment.

So let's get to it. Here is the *who*, *when*, *where*, *why* and *how* of using the best hashtags to generate more comments on your posts and boost your content to the top. üöÄ

\---

**Why: Comments are favored by the algorithm**

Likes are the standard Instagram currency to show appreciation towards someone's content. All it takes is a single tap and not only does the content creator know that you like their post but it lets Instagram know too. This helps Instagram know which other posts to show you but it also informs their algorithm of other people to show that creator's content to. In an over simplified example, would Instagram want to show more of its users a post with 5,000 likes or 3 likes? The post with 5,000 likes is most likely better quality and users would enjoy it more so Instagram is more inclined to show that one.

Of course the Instagram algorithm isn't that simple. It is considering many different data points besides just the number of likes when determining which content to serve. The number of followers to engagement ratio, the speed at which likes/comments/shares occurred on the post, the engagement history of the people who liked or commented are just to name a few. Without deep diving into the Instagram algorithm much further, we just need to understand that comments are much more heavily favored than likes.

It is fast and easy to like something on Instagram. Spending time to read previous comments and type a thoughtful message isn't as quick. Comments happen orders of magnitude less than likes so Instagram favors them in the same way. That is *why* choosing hashtags to garner more comments on your posts is an important addition to your hashtag strategy.

**How: Invoke engagement, clear CTA and use data**

This is the most important part of the equation. Without picking the correct hashtags that entice the user to comment on your content the rest of the strategy falls short. There are certain hashtags that will naturally invoke engagement. These hashtags typically begin with certain keywords that tell the viewer that you want their feedback. Let's look at some examples.

(examples on website since I can't post them here)

You can see a common theme with these examples. They have an actionable prefix/suffix and all provoke action from the viewer. Don't limit yourself to just those ""prefix"" type of hashtags either. There are plenty that are unique that still entice users such as more generic hashtags like #captionthis or #winaprize but also niche specific ones like #shareyourstyle or #grademykicks. The hashtags shouldn't seem like spam and should effortlessly fit into the theme of the caption on your post. Make sure that same caption has a clear call-to-action (CTA) using the hashtag to let the viewer know you want to hear from them.

Don't pick a hashtag that hasn't been used more than 5,000 times and ideally it's closer to 100,000 posts using it. You want to use the hashtag to indicate you want people to comment but you also want this hashtag to bring your content in front of new people. A hashtag that is barely used means that few people will stumble across it and view the hashtag page to ultimately see and comment on your content.

You will also want to also double check that posts that are using the hashtag are actually invoking more comments than normal. What ""more comments"" means is different for everyone. It depends on your niche, account size and many more factors. Once you get into measuring this you should be able to quickly determine which hashtags have a larger number of comments than usual. Look at the number of comments on the Top Posts for that hashtag but also posts that are at least 6 hours old and see how they did.

This part of the strategy can be really tedious. Browsing Instagram to find new hashtags to use, writing down the post count for each, seeing if people comment on that hashtag to make it worth while are all time consuming tasks. Fortunately there are tools like [Curate](https://curate-app.com/) that can save you a lot of time with the whole process. It will automatically retrieve the latest statistics for any hashtag, show you hashtags related to it and even comment your hashtags on each post for you.

1,"I came into a marketing role with a US-based hospitality company and initially it had a respectable following of just over 15k.  


After doing some digging I started to learn that the old team that managed the social kind of screwed the pooch -- they hired some freelancer to grow the following but basically what the freelancer did was use the 'follow-for-follow' method to follow a bunch of travel bloggers / businesses and get them to follow back -- most of whom (over 55%) are users not even from the US and will almost certainly never become customers.  


So the following is steadily declining (down to 14.2K in the last 4 months) likely from a combination of old accounts being closed and our content just not being relevant to the accounts that do follow us.  
I have experience managing smaller social media accounts in the past but the worst thing right now is that our 'hashtag reach' under post insights is pretty much nonexistent (I figure this has something to do with the IG algorithm with larger accounts) so pretty much the only people seeing our posts are the ones who already follow the account.

Hashtag Basics:

I'm going to skip basics since I'm sure all of you are already familiar with basics but if you are not feel free to check my videos or read the article on my website.

How To Get More Followers From Suggestions:

First thing you need to understand is that you always want to use hashtags that are relevant to your niche. Instagram uses image recognition to scan your posts and see what‚Äôs actually on them.

So your goal is to find hashtags that are closely related to the topic of your account. If you are running a theme or niche page like for example travel, with each new post that uses travel-related hashtags you are letting Instagram algorithm know that your account is about travel and it will start pushing your account to more people that are interested in travel.

With each new post, Instagram is basically learning more about your account and the exact category/ niche you are in so it will start recommending you to other people who showed interest in your niche and associating your account with other bigger pages in your niche.

How Many Hashtags You Should Use:

Now because of this when you start a new Instagram page you should find 25-30 really small (REALLY TARGETED) hashtags that are closely related to your niche. And in the beginning, just use those on the first several posts. If your account is in a really broad niche like just travel, where you post different destinations and all kinds of content than there are a ton of small hashtags that you can use. In this case, find several sets of these small hashtags and use different set on each post.

But as I‚Äôve mentioned already in my previous videos and articles you shouldn‚Äôt start the account in a broad niche like that because you will have a much harder time growing. I know a lot of people claim that you should only use up to 5 or 10 hashtags per post and if you use more Instagram will see it as spam, but that‚Äôs just not true. Just think of it, if IG wants you to use 5 hashtags only they wouldn‚Äôt set the limit to 30. I always use between 25 and 30 hashtags and you should too, because you have a chance to rank for each hashtag you use, and if you use 30 hashtags your chances of getting ranked increase by a lot. To rank for a certain hashtag your post needs to be related, and to receive similar engagement in the same amount of time as the posts which are already ranked.

And in the beginning, just use those on the first several posts. If your account is in a really broad niche like just travel, where you post different destinations and all kinds of content than there are a ton of small hashtags that you can use. In this case, find several sets of these small hashtags and use different set on each post.

To rank for a certain hashtag your post needs to be related, and to receive **similar engagement in the same amount of time as the posts which are already ranked**.

**How To Do Hashtag Research:**

Hashtag research is pretty simple but a bit time consuming, the good thing is you basically only need to do it once per each account that you have. You want to go to a broad niche hashtag like for example if you are in travel niche go to #travel if you are in the fitness niche go to #fitness and so on. Now let me show you exactly what you need to do. The account that I‚Äôm growing in my 0 to 10k followers challenge is in a Nordic travel niche and if you want to see how I‚Äôm doing this step make sure to [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sjCNi2oW78).

Video transcript:

As you can see here you will find a list of related hashtags, check one of them and than again you will get a list of related hashtags. Now there are two things you want to write down for each of these hashtags total amount of posts and the lowest amount likes for the top nine posts. If you have time you can also write the average amount of comments but it‚Äôs not really necessary. So, here in this example as you can see, there are 348k total posts, and the average amount of likes is about 5k. The lowest amount of likes is 1.2k, if your post gets more than 1.2k likes within the first day you have a chance to rank for this hashtag.

Now you want to find a lot of these related hashtags and write each of them down along with the total amount of posts, and the lowest amount of likes.

Another way to find more related hashtags is to check each picture that‚Äôs ranking and see hashtags that they are using.

The third way of doing this is to simply go to search and type your keyword and then go to tags and there you go.

At the beginning of each account I usually just go with the second and third method, which saves me a lot of time. There are some websites that you can use for this, but I don‚Äôt really recommend that because almost everyone is using these and you are going to get similar hashtag sets to your competition, in case I find a good tool (paid or free) I will add the link to it here.

Now depending on how broad is your niche you want to find from 30 for really micro niches to 120 for broader niches. You also want to find at least 15-25 general hashtags. In this example specific hashtags would be norway, norwaytravel, visitnorway and so on, these are hashtags that are really closely related to your topic. General hashtags are broader hashtags that are still related like for example travelinggram, traveltheworld, naturephotos and so on.

# Skyscraper Hashtag Strategy

Now as I‚Äôve mentioned already at the beginning of each account (first 9-10 posts) you should use about 25 small laser targeted hashtags that are as closely related to your niche as possible and that have from 1-100k total posts and add additional 3-5 general hashtags. This way you will let Instagram know what your account is all about so they can put you into the right category. After that, you should start using the skyscraper or staircase strategy.

Skyscraper hashtag strategy is a pretty simple yet effective method to start harvesting the power of snowballing effect and **start going viral**. You want to divide hashtags into 6 different groups. First group will be 5 hashtags that range from 5k to 50k total posts, second group 5 hashtags that range from 50k to 250k third group 5 hashtags that range from 250k to 1M in the 4th group you want to use 5 BIG general hashtags, in the 5th group you want to use 3-5 hashtags that are closely related to your actual post 5th group should be different each time since you are publishing different posts.

And in the last group, you want to use 5 hashtags that are really closely related to you niche (it doesn‚Äôt matter how many total posts they have) and you want to use this group every time you post (this builds relevancy). When you combine the first 4 groups you get a **hashtag set**, which should contain 20 hashtags. Now depending on how broad your niche is and the posting frequency you should have at least 2 hashtag sets and if it‚Äôs a really broad niche &amp; you are posting several times per day you want to have 4 or 5 sets.

If you post more than once a day you don‚Äôt want to use one set over and over again, especially if it‚Äôs a broad niche because Instagram can see it as spam. Now this really depends, I have an account for example where I‚Äôve been using absolutely same hashtags over and over again just copy/pasting them for more than a year and haven‚Äôt saw any negative results, but I have a friend who got shadowbanned and once he switched to different hashtag sets he started seeing # reach once again. So just to be safe have at least 2 sets.

**How And Why This Works:**

Let me explain how and why the skyscraper strategy works: Group one contains smaller hashtags which are easy to rank for. If you rank for them you will get more exposure and increased amount of engagement, now with that increased engagement you have a chance to rank for bigger hashtags which are in group 2, this gives you additional exposure and engagement, with that you have a chance to rank for even bigger 3rd group, now once again you get additional reach &amp; engagement which gives you a chance to rank for some of the hashtags from 4th group which are the biggest.

Please note that if you have already established account with more followers and engagement you want to use different total posts range for each group, the example I used is for new or smaller accounts.

In the skyscraper strategy, the most important group is the first one. In the first group, you want to have smaller hashtags that your account have a chance to rank for. So if your posts are usually getting from 50 to 100 likes you want the first group to have hashtags which have top posts that are also between 50 and 100 likes so you have a chance to rank for them and start the snowballing effect.

Once you publish a lot of posts using different hashtag sets you are going to see which set is performing better and gets more reach and engagement and once you do you should use that set more often and discard the worst performing set.

With each new post, Instagram is basically learning more about your account and the exact category/ niche you are in so it will start recommending you to other people who showed interest in your niche and associating your account with other bigger pages in your niche.

**How Many Hashtags You Should Use:**

Now because of this when you start a new Instagram page you should find 25-30 really small (REALLY TARGETED) hashtags that are closely related to your niche. And in the beginning, just use those on the first several posts. If your account is in a really broad niche like just travel, where you post different destinations and all kinds of content than there are a ton of small hashtags that you can use. In this case, find several sets of these small hashtags and use different set on each post.

But as I‚Äôve mentioned already in my previous videos and articles you shouldn‚Äôt start the account in a broad niche like that because you will have a much harder time growing. I know a lot of people claim that you should only use up to 5 or 10 hashtags per post and if you use more Instagram will see it as spam, but that‚Äôs just not true. Just think of it, if IG wants you to use 5 hashtags only they wouldn‚Äôt set the limit to 30. I always use between 25 and 30 hashtags and you should too, because you have a chance to rank for each hashtag you use, and if you use 30 hashtags your chances of getting ranked increase by a lot. To rank for a certain hashtag your post needs to be related, and to receive **similar engagement in the same amount of time as the posts which are already ranked**.

**How To Do Hashtag Research:**

Hashtag research is pretty simple but a bit time consuming, the good thing is you basically only need to do it once per each account that you have. You want to go to a broad niche hashtag like for example if you are in travel niche go to #travel if you are in the fitness niche go to #fitness and so on. Now let me show you exactly what you need to do. The account that I‚Äôm growing in my [0 to 10k followers challenge](https://equalscash.com/my-0-to-10k-instagram-followers-challenge/) is in a Nordic travel niche and if you want to see how I‚Äôm doing this step make sure to [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sjCNi2oW78).

Video transcript:

&gt;!As you can see here you will find a list of related hashtags, check one of them and than again you will get a list of related hashtags. Now there are two things you want to write down for each of these hashtags total amount of posts and the lowest amount likes for the top nine posts. If you have time you can also write the average amount of comments but it‚Äôs not really necessary. So, here in this example as you can see, there are 348k total posts, and the average amount of likes is about 5k. The lowest amount of likes is 1.2k, if your post gets more than 1.2k likes within the first day you have a chance to rank for this hashtag.!&lt;

&gt;!Now you want to find a lot of these related hashtags and write each of them down along with the total amount of posts, and the lowest amount of likes.!&lt;

&gt;!Another way to find more related hashtags is to check each picture that‚Äôs ranking and see hashtags that they are using.!&lt;

&gt;!The third way of doing this is to simply go to search and type your keyword and then go to tags and there you go.!&lt;

&gt;!At the beginning of each account I usually just go with the second and third method, which saves me a lot of time. There are some websites that you can use for this, but I don‚Äôt really recommend that because almost everyone is using these and you are going to get similar hashtag sets to your competition, in case I find a good tool (paid or free) I will add the link to it here.!&lt;

&gt;!Now depending on how broad is your niche you want to find from 30 for really micro niches to 120 for broader niches. You also want to find at least 15-25 general hashtags. In this example specific hashtags would be norway, norwaytravel, visitnorway and so on, these are hashtags that are really closely related to your topic. General hashtags are broader hashtags that are still related like for example travelinggram, traveltheworld, naturephotos and so on.!&lt;

# Skyscraper Hashtag Strategy

Now as I‚Äôve mentioned already at the beginning of each account (first 9-10 posts) you should use about 25 small laser targeted hashtags that are as closely related to your niche as possible and that have from 1-100k total posts and add additional 3-5 general hashtags. This way you will let Instagram know what your account is all about so they can put you into the right category. After that, you should start using the skyscraper or staircase strategy.

Skyscraper hashtag strategy is a pretty simple yet effective method to start harvesting the power of snowballing effect and **start going viral**. You want to divide hashtags into 6 different groups. First group will be 5 hashtags that range from 5k to 50k total posts, second group 5 hashtags that range from 50k to 250k third group 5 hashtags that range from 250k to 1M in the 4th group you want to use 5 BIG general hashtags, in the 5th group you want to use 3-5 hashtags that are closely related to your actual post 5th group should be different each time since you are publishing different posts.

And in the last group, you want to use 5 hashtags that are really closely related to you niche (it doesn‚Äôt matter how many total posts they have) and you want to use this group every time you post (this builds relevancy). When you combine the first 4 groups you get a **hashtag set**, which should contain 20 hashtags. Now depending on how broad your niche is and [the posting frequency](https://equalscash.com/instagram-posting-frequency-how-often-should-you-post/) you should have at least 2 hashtag sets and if it‚Äôs a really broad niche &amp; you are posting several times per day you want to have 4 or 5 sets.

If you post more than once a day you don‚Äôt want to use one set over and over again, especially if it‚Äôs a broad niche because Instagram can see it as spam. Now this really depends, I have an account for example where I‚Äôve been using absolutely same hashtags over and over again just copy/pasting them for more than a year and haven‚Äôt saw any negative results, but I have a friend who got shadowbanned and once he switched to different hashtag sets he started seeing # reach once again. So just to be safe have at least 2 sets.

**How And Why This Works:**

Let me explain how and why the skyscraper strategy works: Group one contains smaller hashtags which are easy to rank for. If you rank for them you will get more exposure and increased amount of engagement, now with that increased engagement you have a chance to rank for bigger hashtags which are in group 2, this gives you additional exposure and engagement, with that you have a chance to rank for even bigger 3rd group, now once again you get additional reach &amp; engagement which gives you a chance to rank for some of the hashtags from 4th group which are the biggest.

Please note that if you have already established account with more followers and engagement you want to use different total posts range for each group, the example I used is for new or smaller accounts.

In the skyscraper strategy, the most important group is the first one. In the first group, you want to have smaller hashtags that your account have a chance to rank for. So if your posts are usually getting from 50 to 100 likes you want the first group to have hashtags which have top posts that are also between 50 and 100 likes so you have a chance to rank for them and start the snowballing effect.

Once you publish a lot of posts using different hashtag sets you are going to see which set is performing better and gets more reach and engagement and once you do you should use that set more often and discard the worst performing set.

That's all info from the first part of my YT series about hashtags and now let's cover the second part.

Again if you want you can watch the second part here: [Ultimate Instagram Hashtag Guide Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271OhKSk__c)

**Brand Hashtags:**

The brand hashtag is simply a hashtag that you invented. I always use my Instagram username as a brand hashtag. These work best on theme/ niche pages and there are two reasons to use them:

1. To get free exposure and content
2. To build more relevancy

On repost pages, you can simply put your brand hashtag in caption saying for example ‚Äúuse #yourbrand if you want to get featured. People are going to start using your hashtag which will lead to more exposure and it‚Äôs also an easy way to discover content for reposting. Since only people in your niche are going to use this hashtag, and you are going to use it in each post this will build more relevancy for your page and Instagram will start pushing your account more as I‚Äôve explained in part one. If you are using my skyscraper hashtag strategy brand hashtag is a part of the group 6.

**Hashtags In Stories:**

The best way to get more story views is with hashtags. From my experience stories without hashtags almost have no ability to rank on the explore page and can‚Äôt rank on the hashtag page. These are great sources to get more story viewers so you want to include hashtags in your stories as well. Just like with post hashtags it‚Äôs really important to use relevant hashtags for your stories.

Hashtag limit for stories is 11 but I did some testing and it seems that 2-4 hashtags work the best when it comes to stories. I always include at least one hashtag that‚Äôs visible, and if you can‚Äôt incorporate more without ruining the look of your stories you can just add the rest by pinching them down so they almost become invisible. I‚Äôm going to make another video &amp; article covering how to rank stories and best practices when it comes to Instagram stories, so stay tuned for that.

**Hashtags In Bio:**

Hashtags in BIO are used to build relevancy. I rarely use them because I haven‚Äôt seen much results from them and they can drive people off your page. On some pages, I use my brand hashtag in bio to encourage people to use my brand hashtags and even if someone clicks on it, they will go to my brand hashtag where most of the posts are mine so it doesn‚Äôt actually drive people off my page. I don‚Äôt recommend adding generic hashtags in your BIO since as I‚Äôve mentioned it doesn‚Äôt have much effect and it can drive people off your page.

**Where To Place Hashtags (Comment or Caption)**

I was always adding hashtags in captions because it was just easier for me, and I thought there‚Äôs no difference in reach if you add them in the first comment, but recently we did some testing and it seems that hashtags in caption perform better than in the first comment. Instagram representatives also publically stated recently that it‚Äôs better to add hashtags in the caption.

**How To Increase Your Chances Of Getting Ranked For Hashtags**

Instagram is trying to fight spam really hard and it‚Äôs starting to affect hashtag performance as well. I‚Äôve mentioned in my previous video that you should use from 25 to 30 hashtags since it gives you a better chance to get ranked and more exposure. However, on some accounts we‚Äôve noticed that Instagram is limiting hashtag reach when we use 30 hashtags instead of 10 for example, but there‚Äôs a simple workaround which seems to boost hashtags performance. Try to include a few hashtags organically throughout your caption and then add the rest at the bottom of your captions like you usually do. I‚Äôve started adding 4-6 hashtags organically in the caption and then the rest at the bottom and it improved my reach a lot on some pages.

Another thing that seems to be working recently is to type all hashtags manually instead of copy/ pasting.

We‚Äôve seen huge improvements on some accounts when we typed everything manually instead of just copy-pasting. Some accounts are completely unaffected by this so you should test it out for yourself.

I don‚Äôt think that Instagram is going to punish users for spamming with hashtags because everyone is doing it, but it seems that they are slowly starting to decrease the hashtag reach for some people that simply spam with hashtags and reward people that use them organically. And this is a great way to mix it up and get benefits from both approaches.

On accounts that are affected by this (better performance when typing manually instead of copy-pasting) we‚Äôve noticed that keyboard replacement trick is not affected so keep that in mind.

**Banned Hashtags**

There are some hashtags that are banned on Instagram and if you include some of them your post is not going to perform very well and if you are using them repeatedly you can get shadowbanned. The best way to find out if the hashtag that you want to use is banned is to actually go to the hashtag page and check it out. Page of banned hashtags looks like this and you should never use it. Make sure to check each of your hashtags manually to see if it‚Äôs banned because there are some really weird words that are actually banned (like for example #desk is currently restricted). You can check [my video](https://youtu.be/271OhKSk__c) for more info on that.

**Common Mistakes**

When it comes to mistakes with hashtags the number one thing that I see people doing is using hashtags that are not relevant. I‚Äôve already mentioned that you should only use relevant hashtags but I‚Äôm doing it again because it‚Äôs really important. Unrelevant hashtags can lower your trust score and lead to shadowban. Make sure that all of your hashtags are closely related to your post.

Another thing that I see people do is that they use huge generic hashtags which they have ZERO ability to rank for. If you don‚Äôt know how to find smaller hashtags that you can actually rank for make sure to check the part one of this hashtag guide.

I‚Äôve seen people using hashtags like #follow4follow #likeforlike and so on, which is a really big mistake. These are spammy hashtags that attract fake engagement and followers who are not targeted and are not interested in your content which means they will never engage with your content. This will hurt your engagement rate in the long run and you should avoid hashtags like these completely.

Finally, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people that are shadowbanned because they use banned hashtags and they don‚Äôt even know about it. As I‚Äôve mentioned make sure to check each hashtag manually to see if it‚Äôs banned and if you used some banned hashtags in the past make sure to edit and delete that hashtag from your previous posts.

**Bonus Tips**

I‚Äôve mentioned that Instagram uses AI and image recognition to scan your posts and actually see what‚Äôs on them but sometimes machines make mistakes. Not a lot of people know this but you can actually use alt text to let Instagram know what‚Äôs on your pictures and videos. If you have time make sure to add keyword-rich alt text for your posts since it can really help you rank for hashtags much better especially if their AI made a mistake while scanning your image. Again, I‚Äôve explained this much better in my video so if you want to find out more check it out.

This is not exactly hashtag related, but I thought I should throw it in here, Use Location Tags it has potential to boost your reach, since IG is ranking posts on a location tag as well, and it can‚Äôt hurt you in any way so why not. This doesn‚Äôt make sense for all niches but it works really well for travel-related niches and local accounts.

30,"This is not a guide that shows you step-by-step methods in order to make money on Instagram. I will not delve into my actual methods of producing income. Imagine you want to learn how to fish. I am not going to tell you where to fish and how to fish - all I'm doing is giving you fishing bait. This guide is meant to give you my personal ideas behind proper Instagram marketing. If you don't agree with my ideas, that's fine. Go ahead and post below and tell me I'm wrong; however, I have used these basic principles for my own success in Instagram and am looking to help those out who are struggling or just starting their internet marketing journey. Numerous people have contacted me recently in an attempt to pick my brain, but I thought this would be more beneficial. I did not proofread this.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by saying this - I started working into the world of Instagram in July of 2015. By no means am I some hipster who has been cashing Benjamins since 2011 on IG. Through numerous failed internet marketing attempts in early summer of 2015, I was led to Instagram as somewhat of a last resort. I've had my own personal Instagram account for a couple years, and I knew the app well enough so I thought to myself, ""Why not? What's the worst that can happen?"" Luckily enough for me, it all turned out pretty well. I learned a lot. Some of them were through mistakes, but some of them were through successes too. I have compiled a list of neat, little tidbits and thoughts that hopefully will help you succeed in Instagram and internet marketing as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pick Your Friends Wisely

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to start off with this one. Through my journey, I have met many great sites like Kioko Media. I have also met some really, really shitty people. I've had friends who have helped me expand my business exponentially, and I have had ""friends"" who steal and cheat things away from me. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Bookmark the Kioko Media Instagram Bot

&amp;#x200B;

There has been several times when consistently checking Kioko Media has saved my accounts. There is a reason to why this is one of the most popular pages on some forums - people post great information here on a daily basis. When Instagram goes through algorithm changes. I think it was in late September when Instagram went through one of the biggest algorithm changes it's ever had. People were losing thousands of accounts, but updated bot settings continued to surface throughout the mayhem. Not only will you stay up to date with Instagram algorithm changes, but you will also discover great methods, ideologies, and theories about Instagram that are a must for any social media nerd.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Create Accounts That Interest You

&amp;#x200B;

I see this all the time. People give up on accounts, and I just don't get it. Whether you are creating your first Instagram account or your 1,000. Create accounts that you will always be engaged with. Create accounts that you will be passionate about. Create accounts that you will care for on a daily basis. Your accounts are your babies. If you love soccer, create soccer accounts. If you love making money, create luxury accounts. If you love working out, create fitness accounts. It's so simple. If you are a vegetarian, don't create accounts about eating meat. It doesn't make sense. If you don't care enough about it in real life, then you won't care enough about it in social media.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Create Accounts That You Have a Vision For

&amp;#x200B;

To follow up on number 3, you have to create accounts that you will know how to monetize. I'm not saying that when you start an account you have to have a 10 page business plan, but you have to know in general how you could make money from it. If you are trying to make money, don't set up a non-profit charity page on Instagram. You are a nice person for doing that, but understand you won't make a dime from that. (... unless you are selling shout-outs from it... but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.) Also understand this - just because you love a niche doesn't mean it's necessarily profitable. Just because you are highly interested and engaged with African aardvarks, doesn't mean there is an audience for African aardvark enthusiasts on Instagram (but don't let me kill your dreams).

&amp;#x200B;

5. Think Outside The Box

&amp;#x200B;

This little tidbit is pretty similar to the previous two, but let's say you still love African aardvarks. While there only might be a handful of people on Instagram that would follow your page and give you love, you can still be creative with the niche and make money. Suppose you create a little fan page for your aardvarks, you can perhaps get some connection with a Zoo and maybe you can workout a deal so you can visit the aardvarks whenever you like. You might not be making money, but you are saving a couple bucks by not having to buy a one-day zoo pass.

&amp;#x200B;

Back on topic, if you have skimmed Im Forums for a couple minutes, you probably have noticed the two big ways people are making money here: selling shoutouts and cost-per-action offers (CPA). There are still more ways you can make money, you just might have to do some digging (like a aardvark. Get it? Because burrows...). Contacting companies, creating your own company, selling clothes, apps, etc, etc the list goes on and on. Nothing works unless you do. Think outside the box and figure out ways to put money in your pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

6. There Is No Such Thing as Saturation

&amp;#x200B;

It pains me to say it, but... Instagram is not saturated at all. A lot of whitehat people write-off Instagram as ""unmarketable"" because advertising on Instagram seems to be pretty dull. There isn't really much of a call-to-action on Instagram because you can't place links in posts, and Instagram ads is about 3 years away from being profitable; however, even the annoying niches like fashion, fitness, and luxury are still wide open for opportunities if you know what you are getting yourself into. Sure, there might be a lot of accounts out there in those niches, but if you figure out ways to make your account(s) better, it won't take long before you start taking their followers and their profits (and their women, probably). If you are familiar with the Pareto principle (if not, Google it quick), Instagram is a lot like the 80/20 rule; however, it might be a tad different. It's probably close to 90/10 or even 95/5. Sure, let's stick with 95/5. 95% of the money being earning on Instagram is being made by 5% of the marketers. Most people probably think, ""Damn, I can't make any money then. I'll just do Clickbank marketing instead with miniblogs."" But if you were smart you would think like this, ""What can I do to get in that 5%?""

&amp;#x200B;

Generally speaking, saturation exists to some extent in Instagram and internet marketing. I am aware that contradicts what I just bolded. Sometimes there are too many people doing something, but that shouldn't stop you from doing it if you have the proper vision for success. Most of the niches I am engaged in (fitness, fashion, etc) are pretty saturated, but that didn't stop me from turning a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind of like the old saying, ""If everyone is jumping off a cliff, would you do it?"" If you got a cool parachute that no one else has then go jump off that cliff.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Post Original Content

&amp;#x200B;

Posting original content is always going to be your best bet. Sure, if you are uncreative this might not be your strong suit, but posting original content is a major key to success for several reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You will stand out from your competition

You will more than likely stay away from IG's violation squad (especially if you are botting)

You will be unique and memorable

You will be happy

Aardvarks shouldn't live in zoos all their life

&amp;#x200B;

Posting original content can be as simple as watermarking images or videos (content you have the right to watermark...maybe). There was a great thread earlier that showed increased engagement rates (comments and likes per photo/video) from simply watermarking their content. Posting original content often is important. All accounts should be posting everyday, if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

Too many times I see accounts that post the same reposted pictures again and again. Always assume your audience is half-way educated, at least. They will know bullshit when they see it. If you are going to go with the reposting route, try and find lesser-known people to repost. You can't just go around posting Katy Perry pictures all day and expect your account to blow up (like a firework).

8. Always Expand Your Empire

&amp;#x200B;

Too often in internet marketing and life you will be struck with complacency. But as the old proverb goes - complacency is the enemy of progress. I'm not saying you should have thousands of accounts you can't run effectively or with care, but always look for ways to grow your Instagram empire. You should always have more than one cared-for Instagram account. You can always find the time to work on one more account.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

QUICK TIDBITS

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

9. I would advise against buying accounts. It's too easy to recover accounts. If they can't monetize it, you probably won't be able to either. There is probably a good reason why they are selling it. Better safe than sorry. That being said, I have bought accounts before with success; however, I've had more bad experiences with it than good experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

10. FollowLiker is the best thing we got right now for Instagram account automation. It's not amazing, but it's not terrible. For the price, it's the best you can get. Buy the extended version (with unlimited licenses). It's a good investment. I believe you can buy it here in the marketplace.

&amp;#x200B;

11. Never fake followers. Under rare conditions is it allowed to fake likes and comments, but never fake followers. There is no use for it. They are deadweight. Also, be aware that some shoutout providers fake their engagement rate with fake likes and comments. I know most people go to IGERSLike for their Instagram panel, but there are also many quality dealers here in the Kioko Media marketplace for followers, likes, comments, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

12. Aged accounts will always perform better under stress. Accounts that are at least 6 months old do better in automated activities than other accounts will. Instagram will see older accounts and give them some leeway. Instagram will see newer accounts and give them the banhammer.

&amp;#x200B;

13. Accounts also need to be warmed up. Don't go full-blast right away with liking, commenting, following, etc. Start small and build bigger. I post a good example of this here.

&amp;#x200B;

14. Always keep a couple tester accounts on hand to test limits, engagement, etc. Make sure these are the same age as your main accounts. Be bold with these accounts. Be crazy with these accounts. They are meant to test and push the limit for a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

15. Make your own accounts if you can. You will just feel more at home when you do. Buy SIM cards. I think you can currently create around 5 accounts per phone. It could be much more than that but it's not much less. You are very safe if you have a personal account and a business account on the same phone/proxy right away. Make sure you use 3G/4G if you log into your phone with an account that usually is on a different proxy. Also, most phones you can add proxy settings if you prefer to use WiFi.

&amp;#x200B;

16. Buy a VPS if you are using FollowLiker. I like it better than keeping my computer online all day. I use GreenCloudVPS but you can use whatever suits you.

&amp;#x200B;

17. Typically you will always be safe with 1 proxy per 1 account initially. When your accounts get older it becomes more and more okay to push that limit. I would never go above 3 accounts per proxy, but there is always some crazy person on Kioko Media saying he's got like 7 accounts on one proxy. It's your call. I use SSLPrivateProxy but they are sometimes unreliable with support.

&amp;#x200B;

18. I've never seen the point of doing ""giveaways"" but I could be wrong. I've never experimented with it. My theory is people who sign up for ""giveaways"" usually don't want to buy anything. But if you can find a way around that, kudos to you.

&amp;#x200B;

19. You don't need big accounts to be successful with Instagram. You don't need thousands of accounts. Across all of my accounts I'm not deep into the 6 figure following range. That's really only a small loan of a million dollars when you think about it (political humor). My audience; however, is laser targeted, and that's all that matters. Good engagement rate and a following with an open checkbook is all it takes to make money in Instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

20. Be aware that doing shout-for-shouts (S4S) devalues the credibility of your account. When I see an account doing a ""shout-out"" I almost always unfollow or ignore that account. Shout-for-shouts are great for gaining followers, but understand that comes at a price. Buying shout-outs instead of trading shout-outs is preferred if you can afford it, just make sure you are doing it from a credible account.

&amp;#x200B;

21. If you aren't having success with Instagram, don't stress about it. I've bounced around from niche to niche, from offline marketing to Craigslist - when you know, you know. Building a broad awareness and becoming a jack-of-all-trades isn't such a bad thing in Internet Marketing. Using what you know from Instagram and applying it to other things can be very beneficial. The more you know, the better. You need to be laser-focused on a niche to be successful, and if you know from the start that you won't ever be laser-focused in on Instagram, then you might be wasting your time.

If you've fiddled around with Instagram more than you'd care to admit...

If you've Googled ""what's the best time to post on Instagram,"" ¬†forgotten the answer, and mainly post Stories now anyway.

## You and I think we've tried every Instagram growth hack there is...

### Except I know you haven't tried this.

We've been pitched on Instagram followers before ‚Äî fake ones, foreign ones, ghost ones ‚Äî pitched the same thing so many times you've stopped listening.

I'll bet that if I told you that if I had a way to get you 2,000 real Instagram followers in a week for only $500 you'd think they were fake, foreign, or that i was lying.

You'd say that you'd tried it, seen it, heard it, been there.

## 1300+ split tests reveal an exciting new way forward for Instagram Marketers

### Hint: Mega-Influencers

Over the past two years my company has helped over 7,000 clients succeed on Instagram, in a variety of different ways.

I'll repeat what you already know: yesterday's growth hacks don't work nearly as well as they used to...

and they're expensive!

## I've spend the better part of the last 6 months

### searching for a better way...

As a result I've made an amazing discovery that is without a doubt, the fastest, most reliable, and most cost-effective way to grow an Instagram account to over 100,000 followers in less than a year.

To find it, I had to test over 1300+ experiments.

Then just last month, in September 2019, finally one of the tests got me excited enough to draft this overly long, gushing letter, in hopes that someone like you might find it and actually read it in full.

Not only was this the single best performing test I've ever ran, it's dirt cheap, and 100% kosher with Instagram's terms of service.

But it's not for everyone. In fact most Instagram marketers won't even qualify to do this.

## The best part?

### Hardly anyone is doing it...

They will very soon though.

According to Gary Vaynerchuk, marketers ruin everything.

The good ones make their money before the mainstream arrives, and the great ones bet big when they do.

## I'd like to tell you about a great marketer I know,

### who's going all in on this.

(We'll call him **S.**)

**S.** is probably the best known real estate agent in San Diego, a longtime client of Jumper Media, and a friend. He has around 50k followers, not a crazy amount, but the thing is: *he regularly sells multi-million dollar homes on Instagram.*

He's not a vanity metrics kind of guy. Smart.

He's been through every Instagram algorithm change, every new feature, been with our company through thick and thin, and has his fair share of battle scars to prove it.¬†

But he's always willing to try new things, and we love that about¬†**S.**

## What we did was so simple, it's disgusting.

On August 31, 2019 we partnered with an Instagram mega-influencer to give away a $4000 Gucci bag.

To enter the contest, she told people to go follow a list of 20 accounts that we gave her. (Our clients, of course).

If you were one of those accounts, you would have gotten over 6,350 followers that day.

**And if you were like S., you would have called us immediately.**

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†*""I've never seen anything like this. How the heck did you ‚Äî they just keep coming in!!!""*

We double checked, and these weren't fake either, just real people entering a contest on Instagram, mostly in the USA.

And that's the precise moment in time when we knew we had something.

## Introducing Jumper Loops for Instagram

### Partner with mega-influencers to dominate Instagram in a (borderline unfair) new way.

My COO was hesitant to even offer this publicly ‚Äî these giveaways are a lot of work for us to coordinate, and since we only run a few a month there is very limited space, which means there isn't a lot in it for us.

But after all 20 of our test clients decided they wanted to participate again the following month, we knew we had to bite the bullet and try to find more influencers to do this with.

As we ramp up our network of mega-influencers, we are offering these Loop Giveaway packages starting at an unbelievable price: a one-time fee of $459.

That's just our introductory package, we offer much larger ones for folks that want 10k+ followers or more at a time.

And that's not all...

### I guarantee you'll get at least 2,000 followers or your money back.

*Who would do that?*

Only a crazy person, like me üòâ

If all this sounds good to you, and you'd like to talk with one of my company executives personally about getting you similar results, then...

## Here's What I Want You To Do Next:

Send a friendly email to [loops@jumpermedia.co](mailto:loops@jumpermedia.co) about what you‚Äôre working on, and include your Instagram handle.

We‚Äôll be happy to answer questions and help you figure out whether it‚Äôs a good fit. We'll probably want to hop on the phone quickly too, just 15 minutes to finalize the details, etcetera.

### Lastly, There Are 3 Important Things You Should Know Before Getting in Touch

Availability is extremely limited due to the intense one-on-one time needed to setup each loop giveaway with the influencers. Therefore it is physically impossible for us to work with more than a few dozen people per month.

Moreover, the influencers we work with can be picky about the accounts they choose to promote, so sadly we can't guarantee every account will meet their standards.

Also, you should realize there is a very large demand for easy ways to grow Instagram followers right now, and what we're offering you is unprecedented.

So with that said, know the window of opportunity won't last long.

my posts are getting a good amount of likes and impressions, however i'm not getting many followers.. not sure if it's an issue of not having any ""social proof"" as i've only got 24 followers (people want to follow accounts they think other people are already following)?? 

my question is this - would buying 1000 followers to get a bit more ""social proof"" hurt my account / the way the instagram algorithm works? if so, is there anything else i can be doing to maximize my conversion rate from impressions and profile views to actual followers?

So the unintelligent algorithm is bumping to the top of the feed what it thinks are my favorite accounts and consequently these accounts are going to artificially seem more and more to the algorithm like they are my favorites because I will always ""like"" the posts near the top.  A positive feedback loop based upon shoddy evidence that the unintelligent algorithm is clueless of.  The whole thing is complete and utter nonsense.

83,"It‚Äôs my belief that when it comes to blogging for business ‚Äì content is king ‚Äì Including social media &amp; Instagram content. 

It‚Äôs no surprise that visual content is 40 times more likely to get shared on social media than other types of content. That‚Äôs why social media platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat continue to grow in popularity. They are visual, and have a unique way of delivering a complex message all within a few seconds.

Lately, we‚Äôve been specifically obsessed with Instagram. So, to help you get ready for creating your Instagram content, I‚Äôve got an ultimate guide that covers exactly how to create content for your Instagram account and where you can find them and how to editing.

**Why quality Instagram content is so important?**

The reality is that people usually don‚Äôt see all the new posts when they visit Instagram. [A study by Instagram](http://blog.instagram.com/post/145322772067/160602-news) themselves found that before the algorithm, on average, **users missed 70 percent of the posts on their feeds** and 50 percent of the posts from their friends.

Let‚Äôs talk about the Instagram algorithm. The Explore tab uses an algorithm to surface content based on the user‚Äôs interests and past behaviors.

As long as you are creating engaging, relevant, and timely content, the algorithm is actually an advantage to you. It is a brilliant way for your great content to reach more people and it puts you and your posts in a better position and in front of new audiences.

# Creating Instagram Content

Before you start, you should ask yourself these two questions:

Firstly, what type of content aligns with your brand? And what does your audience want to see?

Being able to pinpoint the who, what and why about your Instagram brand is a really important step for planning out your content. If you know what your brand is about, and what kind of content your audience likes to engage in, you‚Äôll really be able to hone in, and create the right type of content from the start.

Finding your brand niche and really dedicating your efforts to just that niche will pay off. A lot of Instagram accounts get sidetracked with posting content outside of their target audience and niche, and that could be slowing down your growth.

***What type of Instagram content should we post?***

There are plenty of ways to create an engaging feed with a cool aesthetic‚Äì even if you‚Äôre selling something as unglamorous or promoting an entirely digital product that seems impossible to visualize.

For the first let me tell you 7 tips that you should consider when you creating posts and here are some ideas for you.

Let‚Äôs Dive in:

**1. Templates:**

Thankfully, these days there are loads of great websites that offer pre-designed templates you can tweak to fit your needs with minimal effort.

Online design tools such as [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), [lucidpress](https://www.lucidpress.com/), [Snappa](https://snappa.com/), and [Stencil](https://getstencil.com/) are the perfect sample for creating engaging content for Instagram posts and story and even other social media posts.

You just need to select one template and you can customize them by adding text overlays, filters, icons, borders‚Ä¶whatever you like. However, you don‚Äôt need to do much‚Äìin fact, the less you change a template, the better. 

![img](iajvvg92vv931 ""Canva"")

![img](nyxobi92vv931 ""Stencil"")

**2.** **High-quality stock images**

Stock Images can help you create a varied feed when used with a mixture of other images, such as templates.

To find high-quality photos head to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Stocksnap.io](https://stocksnap.io/). They offer a range of images for free, and you‚Äôre bound to find something suitable whatever your niche.

If you have a bit of a budget to spend, try [Stocksy](https://www.stocksy.com/). As you would expect for a paid service, the quality of the images is higher, and the variety is wider.

![img](4fq4zwiavv931 ""Stocksy"")

**3. User-generated content** 

(UGC) occurs when a customer organically creates content that is in reference to your brand, product or service. 

User-generated content serves as a powerful customer endorsement that can encourage prospects to consider your brand more seriously. Additionally, user-generated content provides Instagram marketers with creative new content to re-share via your account.

Get around this by running a competition where users can win something by creating an Instagram post and tagging it with your own brand hashtag, or a campaign hashtag.

Offering followers a free product or a discount, for example, will help you build momentum for your campaign as more users are likely to use your hashtag.

Keep in mind that you shouldn‚Äôt be too restrictive with the type of content you ask your users to post, otherwise they aren‚Äôt going to bother!

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Shooting Photos**

One thing you‚Äôre going to need to create Instagram content is a camera. But if a fancy DSLR camera and all the accessories that come with it aren‚Äôt in your budget, don‚Äôt worry.

What‚Äôs more important is the content and composition of your photos but always plan what your photos are going to look like.

Start thinking about the angles the photo will be taken from, your position in relation to the camera, the lighting, and composition.

One tip that you should try out on your next shoot is to take as many photos as possible. Think about changing the composition, your distance from the camera, your pose, having a close-up, or changing the angle from where the photo is taken. Not only will this mean you‚Äôll be able to pick the best from the bunch to post to Instagram, but you‚Äôll also have more content for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Contest &amp; Giveaways**

One way for Businesses to gain more audience on Instagram is to run promotional campaigns with Hashtags or photo contests asking your audience to share images relevant to your brand.

Contests and giveaways posts will naturally receive more engagement than normal as there‚Äôs an incentive to like and comment, and your audience will tag their friends thereby increasing the reach of your post (and a contest!). 

To pull off a successful Instagram contest, make sure you have an appropriate prize ready, provide clear steps to enter for participants, set a deadline and decide how you‚Äôll select the winner! 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Behind the Scene**

People like to do business with people, not brands.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more important than ever to create a human connection with your customers. Showing them glimpses of your staff, and the things that go on behind-the-scenes is a one really effective way of doing so.

It creates transparency that allows followers to feel like they‚Äôre getting to know the ‚Äúreal you‚Äù behind the brand. This builds trust, and it‚Äôs a refreshing change of pace after a stream of product images.

Another Bonus is that behind the scenes content doesn‚Äôt need to be nearly as polished as some of your other images. Because of this, some brands (including [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/), pictured below) prefer to keep their behind-the-scenes content exclusively to their Stories.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Storytelling**

Creating a story with your product engages consumers and creates a compelling reason for them to click on your site and start shopping.

This strategy works for pretty much any product category.

A powerful way to tell your brand story is using the 5 W‚Äôs to come up with content ideas: who, what, when, where, and why?

*  Who: Who has been the biggest supporter of your business? Who inspires you? Who do you work with? Who do you serve? 
*  What: What have been some obstacles that you have overcome? What are you reading or listening to? What are your recent wins? 
*  When: When do you do your best work? When do you celebrate? When do you relax? 
*  Where: Where do you work, dream, think, or recharge? Where do you get inspiration from? 
*  Why: Why did you start your business? Why do you do things a certain way? 

What ‚ÄúW‚Äù can you answer right now? Pick one that feels relevant to you today and takes 5 minutes to create a post. 

![img](hgio9xvkvv931)

Another example of storytelling is showcasing yourself at work or your company‚Äôs employees in action is great for putting a human face on your brand, which makes what you share on Instagram more interesting to your followers. 

 *Here are some post Ideas to spice up your feed:* 

* **Product Posts:** Pictures and videos of your products will likely be one of the easiest (and most expected) places to start on Instagram. Sharing content featuring your products in all their glory will, of course, help you drive sales and promote your business on Instagram. 
* **Product Launches:** Instagram provides a great platform for launching new products or upgrades but simply adding a photo of your product can be a bit ho-hum when it comes to your Instagram posts. Create something that stands out and makes us stop and look further. You can provide more context in your description after grabbing attention with a great image. 
* **Offers and Promotions:** If you have a promotion or sale, don‚Äôt forget to share it on Instagram.  The more creative and visual you can make it the better.  If you have over 10,000 followers or a verified account you can also add ‚ÄúSwipe Up‚Äù links on Instagram Stories to encourage followers to swipe/click through to your content. 
* **Events, Holiday and Seasonal posts:** Take advantage of this by creating seasonal posts that are timely and immediately relevant. Posts about summer vacations, winter weather, and even a specific meteor shower can work in addition to the obvious holidays, too. Or you can post content from before, during, and after the event to create more hype. This can be an event that your business is hosting, or one that you‚Äôve been invited to attend. 
* **Quotes &amp; Memes:** Regardless of industry and audience, a quote or meme is a great way to convey information and emotion to your followers and boost engagement. The possibilities are endless with text posts! They could be humorous, informative, emotive, or simply some nice looking typography, and the best part is that any brand can use this Instagram post idea and make it relevant to their audience. 
* **Provide Video Tutorials:** Video tutorials have the distinct advantage of being immediately valuable and actionable to your target audience. Even a thirty second video showing them how to use, care for, or set up your product will go a long way and if you can show how easy your products are to use or how valuable they are, you might be able to make some sales too. 
* **Stats and Numbers:** Stats and number can be used to tell a story too. The key is to make it visual and engaging. No need to say that just use statistics and numbers that relevant to your niche to satisfying your followers. 
* **Other Users Posts:** When you find a post you want to share with your followers, simply send a DM to the user or comment on the photo to let them know you a) love their Instagram content and that you think your users will enjoy it too, and b) to ask for permission to share it to your feed. 
* **Thought Leadership:** Ask yourself how can you help your followers or audience with what you know and your thoughts, ideas, and predictions on a particular topic? Don‚Äôt be afraid to share it in a visual way with images or video ‚Äì or even via Instagram Stories. 
* **Questions and Answers:** Answering customer questions on Instagram will encourage more people to follow you (especially if there‚Äôs a chance for you to answer their own questions). You can have Q&amp;As written out in a text-based image, having one question and answer to a post. Remember that the character limit for captions is 2,200 characters, so you can actually squeeze quite a bit of writing into your post, if you want to. Instagram even released a Questions Sticker that you can use to solicit answers from your audience and share your response as a photo or video. 
* **Link to Blog Content:** Instagram is not about getting people to link away from Instagram as it is for other platforms. However, you might want to lead them to your website, blog content or podcast. Make sure your image or video are engaging and be sure to add some helpful information in your caption.

# Editing Your Instagram Content

If you look at some of the most successful accounts on Instagram, you‚Äôll notice they all have one thing in common, regardless of what industry they‚Äôre in. They all have a strong Instagram aesthetic that they stick to!

To captivate your Instagram followers, you‚Äôll need to make sure your photos and videos are edited properly. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hire a professional editor.

There are plenty of apps available that are really easy for anyone to use. Lots of these are free of charge or only cost a couple of dollars, so they are worth a try.

Everyone with an Instagram account has access to the same filters and editing tools.

Editing your photos with another app can separate your pictures from the crowd. All of these apps are unique and offer different features depending on what you‚Äôre looking for, such as collages, text overlays, face touch-ups, or vintage themes.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of some best apps: 

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Afterlight** ([Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/afterlight/9wzdncrdbq44) , [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457) , [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fueled.afterlight&amp;hl=en_US))

The only paid app on this list, Afterlight definitely earns its keep. The quality and simplicity of the app make it a joy to use and the functionality is also second to none. 

Afterlight comes built-in with all the standard editing tools you‚Äôd expect from a high caliber app; Saturation, Contrast, Exposure, and even RBG Shadow tones can be adjusted, but that‚Äôs not all.

They also have some really cool effects and designs that allow you to add text and other typography to your images:

You can even put part of your text behind elements within your photo. This feature is perfect for businesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Snapseed** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619) , [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;hl=en_US))

Snapseed takes your editing effects to a whole new level. You can apply effects and filters to specific areas of your image with high precision:

If you manage to get a decent shot on your camera and need to do some minimal editing work, Snapseed will do it for you in the least amount of time.

They‚Äôve got a really cool editing feature called a perspective tool. This helps you automatically adjust or correct any skewed lines in your images.

Let‚Äôs face it, a picture taken by hand won‚Äôt be 100% perfect. You might think your horizon is level or buildings are lined up properly, but that‚Äôs rarely the case.

That‚Äôs when the perspective tool can make your photos look professional.

What‚Äôs the best part about Snapseed? It‚Äôs free. 

  

**3.** **VSCO** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vsco-photo-video-editor/id588013838) &amp; [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&amp;hl=en_US))

Having VSCO on your smartphone is like carrying a Swiss knife with you. Houses all the tools you‚Äôd expect from a favorable photo editing app; saturation, highlights, temperature, and vignette can all be adjusted alongside many other settings. 

VSCO also offers a built-in camera with advanced controls, allowing you to capture the perfect shot, edit and save, all without leaving the app. 

Filters are also a huge feature for VSCO, with the option to buy filter packs each with their own distinctive styles and tones, very popular amongst users of the app.

Highly recommended for those wanting to evolve their Instagram to the next level. 

  

**4. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (** [Web-App](https://lightroom.adobe.com/) **,** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom/id878783582) **,** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.lrmobile&amp;hl=en_US) **,** [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)**)**

This entry on the list is probably more suited to those who have a real passion for photography and want an editing app that provides advanced editing functionality on the go. 

The app comes stacked with tons of tools giving you the ability to change almost every single detail in an image, and of course, preset filters are readily available.

Lightroom also houses a built-in camera, with a pro mode that gives you control over settings such as Shutter Speed, White Balance, and ISO.

One of the unique features of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is the Creative Cloud Photography plan, essentially a monthly subscription with Adobe, providing benefits such as; access your media anywhere, sync photo edits across all devices, Photoshop CC and much more.

The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom app is a must-have for those who take the art of photography seriously, or even for those who want to learn more about photo editing. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Another great time-saving tip is to edit the content for the week in one sitting. By setting time aside just for editing, not only will it help you see what your final photos for the week will look like, but it helps you be more organized for posting your Instagram Content! 

# Posting Your Instagram Content

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make a post to help and discuss about instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

I've grown instagram accounts in the past and sold them. I have recently started fresh once again just to prove that the instagram ""algorithm"" isn't actually a bad thing after all. I mention this because people are blaming the algorithm for their stunt in growth on instagram or the reason it's impossible to grow. I believe both statements are not true..

&amp;#x200B;

Most people don't know how to grow their accounts, manage them or even monetise. A lot of people also ain't motivated enough so they give up and say it doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have within the last month created a niche account, grew it from 0 to just under 400 followers, I generally get on a video between 500 to 7,000 views. And the page can usually pull in anywhere between 5 to 20 followers per post which is good growth for a fairly new account. Oh and I forgot to mention I did this completely free, I never paid for shoutouts etc.. I also did not leverage any of my other accounts to do this.

""Instagram also takes into consideration exactly how a person uses the app. For users who use the app every single day and regularly scroll through their feed, it's more likely they will see posts made that day because they likely already saw posts from prior days. Users who only open the app on weekends are more likely to see posts from the course of the week mixed in. Number of followers also matters. If a person only follows a handful of accounts, it's likely they will see everything posted in a given day. If they follow 2,000 accounts, Instagram attempts to prioritize what posts they are most likely to want to see.

Odds are good that you'll continue to see posts claiming that Instagram's algorithm is limiting a user's audience.

&gt;**Marketing automation is about using software to automate marketing activities. Technology can help marketing sections to do a repetitive task such as sending emails, website, or even social media activities.**

Since these kind of duties are time-consuming and sometimes complicated; marketing automation can remarkably help to make it easier and more accurate.

 

## What Is Marketing Automation?

Marketing automation is a system in which software can do the repetitive marketing task instead of a human. However, **marketing automation** has different categories including email marketing, social media automation such as Instagram automation, website automation and so on. Here I will explain more about marketing automation on social media such as Instagram.

## What Is Instagram Automation?

Instagram automation is about using technology to do Instagram activities on behalf of a person. With the help of technology, you can post, like, or comment as you need. **Instagram automation** is becoming more and more critical because social media‚Äôs trends are increasing. It can save your time and grow your Instagram accounts. Understanding **Instagram algorithm** is essential if you aim to improve your account through Instagram automation.

&amp;#x200B;

#  The Importance of having Instagram 

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, if people want to buy from a brand, **they first check their social media profile**. Instagram is especially useful for this because it has a business profile option on it. Even if you want to use it for personal life, you can easily switch it to a business account, to get the best of it. There are some useful features on the business account such as insights, which show you the number of shares or save by users. You also can see the audience analytics, from which regions, or countries they most come. It also shows you the number of people who have visited your profile.

Understanding Instagram algorithm is essential if you aim to grow your account through Instagram automation. If you read about the Instagram algorithm, you see that it is changing every year, and sometimes in a couple of months, based on the users‚Äô behaviors. For example, the new Instagram algorithm is about user‚Äôs engagements. You will see the posts, that you have more engagements with the related profiles. That‚Äôs why if you want to get updates from your favorite pages, you have to turn the post notifications on their profile. Marketing automation would help you to keep contacting with others, which is an essential step of growing your Instagram account.

 

Here I would explain more about building relationships, which can lead to your success. As I have written above, you need to engage with others, to get known by the. You should like, comment, visit their profiles. Instagram automation is a great help for you, but you have some other strategies you can add. Build your relationships with your audience through your posts and stories. You should show people that your profile is real, and somehow not a selfish person/company to add people and sell its products. You can randomly select some of your audience in a competition or challenge you already prepared. You can even send them some gifts, if you get positive feedback from the public, you grow more. Therefore, don‚Äôt just wait for automation to do all things for you. Show some activities that are specifically from you, and it is made for the specific people. Positive comments that you have received from people through your actions have a remarkable effect on your profile quality and encourage others to follow you. It shows that you have a real connection with others, and it shows some kindness or a favorable profile, which people are interested in. Improving a profile is a mixture of different strategies.

The benefits of using automation is not about **saving time** only or doing activities that are beyond human abilities, but also have plans for your actions on Instagram. A very first step of having a successful business or even an account is a plan. With doing so, you can analyze which kind of users you need to engage with, which kind of posts you need to publish more. However, it is sometimes challenging to find a trustable Instagram automation service. Hopefully, there is some excellent read about choosing safe and effective Instagram automation.

 How you can get the best of Instagram automation is about how you plan your actions. If you consider the relevant users and taking action with the relevant content so will get the best of Instagram automation. In this regards, you can consult with the service provider to do the right activities for your account or your business. Before starting with Instagram automation is better for you to have some basic knowledge of **Instagram automation marketing**, online business and at which stage your business or you are. I believe if you have recently started your business, or you are going to expand your business profile on social media using automation you are at right place. But if you asked yourself how the business knowledge would help you, I would explain to you here. It is true that it would help you a lot to grow, especially if you have recently started, but there are some other essential matters. For example, who is your targeted audience? Do you know which kind of profile you need to engage with them? Do you know the best time to post your contents? Or any ideas about the post size, quality, or which kind of post your audience like to hear from you? All these matters, and while you get the help of Instagram automation, you should know about it. So, better to use it with knowledge. 

 

# What do you expect from Instagram automation?

&amp;#x200B;

 I believe our expectation from everything, would shape our satisfaction level. If you assume too much or something not reachable, you soon get disappointed. Do you think of becoming Instagram famous overnight? Or you reach more than 100,000 audiences within a week? It is true that everything is possible, but to what probability? You know that you have to be patient, you need to wait, try many ways, do several posts and build your relationships. Instagram automation can help you, but you should stop trying other strategies too. I mean being a successful marketer, or online business is all about a combination of many strategies that work together and shape your dream.

Is always good to get the help of new strategies, having new ideas and see what‚Äôs the trend is. Instagram marketing is competitive, and you should do your best to get to the top, or at least achieve your goal, or even achieving what you have expected from using **Instagram marketing**. Online marketing and specifically social media marketing like Instagram is an ever increasing trend; you can take benefits. See what skills, ability or product you have! I believe if you are in business or not, you can have a product. It can be making people happy, or make them healthier or even more prosperous. It is all about your vision, and fortunately in the Instagram marketing you not necessarily need a formally registered company. Your personal goal or personal vision is your product. Instagram automation can help you to get closer to your goal. So, a better understanding of your place and your product is a big help to grow.

 

Your account can be anything, from a personal account, with some goal about giving people free exercise lessons to an account to sell your beauty products or anything else. There is no limitation on your products choice.

**Conclusion**

Instagram automation is about using technology to grow your or your business account. It will help you to build your relationships with your audience better.

I hope you can help me.
I think I have been shadowbanned from IG (even though they claim that isnt a thing?)

I run the IG account serenity_vanity (makeup, currently at 18k followers)
Its run 100% organic and according to rules (or so I thought??)

For the last week Im not showing up in ANY hashtags on any of my posts. Meaning that my posts are only shown to the few of my followers that the IG algorithm chooses to show them to.

After researching a LOT of YT videos I can only think of one thing that could have resulted in this: I have been using the same hashtags for the last 6-7 posts. From what I have learned, this can result in a shadowban?

I have contacted IG 7 times but no luck.
Took 3 days of instagram not doing anything, but still isnt working.

Can any of you guys tell me Im correctly assuming that I am shadowbanned? And is it correctly to assume that it is because of using the same hashtags? Is a shadowban permanent or will it fix itself after some time, and if so, how long?

&amp;#x200B;

So have recently began an Instagram account in recent weeks, that has gained quite a lot of popularity surprisingly quickly. So while I am aware I am not in a position to monetize it at the moment, in the future it is something I would be looking to do - only when reaching north of 10k followers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So a bit of background that way be of some benefit to anyone that would like to help offer a few suggestions of how to go about this: 

* It's a ""feel good account"" with a certain slant, not going to give out the handle for obvious self promotion reasons, but it is relevant in the greater scheme of things. 
* Engagement at the moment is in and around 8.4 - 16% depends on the hashtags that I use along with the general nature of the posts it seems. 
* Besides that fact there is a ""core"" audience that is seemingly growing, people that message and converse with regularly through DMs, reply to all stories, like everything &amp; comment etc. 

Anyway so at the moment, I know my account is not ready to monetize - as don't want to annoy any of the followers. 

But going forward, I need to get a larger following of these followers that engage with everything. As of course understanding what they like and getting that first batch of likes in once a post is posted, is essential for beating the Instagram algorithm etc.

143," Although there are many factors that determine what you see in your Instagram feed, there are some misconceptions about Instagram feed and how Instagram works. Here, we will address four common misconceptions about the Instagram algorithm to find out how Instagram works. 

 **Misconception #1: Instagram gives extra weight to videos within its feed!** 

 If you are trying to grow your account and gain more followers then it's so important that you understand how Instagram works in case of photos and videos. Instagram doesn‚Äôt look at photo or video content differently. One type of content will rank higher if a user engages with it more often, but unlike some other channels, videos will not rank over photos and vice versa. 

 Engagement groups are groups of people on Instagram who agree to Like and Comment on every post uploaded by a group member. So, your content will rank higher easily because of greater engagement and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you post photos or videos. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Misconception #2: Having a business profile reduces your chances of being seen!** 

 Despite rumors that Instagram suppresses posts from accounts with business profiles, probably to encourage advertising, there is no evidence that it is a factor in the Instagram algorithm. So, this is important to know how Instagram works in this case. Whether somebody has upgraded to a business profile or not does not have a direct impact on where their posts appear high in an individual user‚Äôs newsfeed. It doesn't matter if you have a business or personal account. Instagram doesn't give better visibility for one over the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Misconception #3: Instagram accounts are down-ranked for posting content too frequently.**  

Users who post too often are not ranked lower in the feed, but if the time between posts become too short, Instagram will break up your posts and add other user‚Äôs posts between them.

By good luck, this is where using a well-planned Instagram scheduler can help you solve this problem. Instead of waking up one morning and post all of your contents once, you can be safe by planning all of your posts for the upcoming week in one day. AiGrow is a perfect tool that has emerged making it easy to create and use a social media calendar.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Misconception #4: Posting Stories, Live videos or IGTV will affect ranking.** 

 Should I use Stories, Live or IGTV to rank higher? Actually, Instagram doesn‚Äôt rank higher users who create Instagram Stories, publish IGTV or broadcast Live. It is a myth that using these features of the app affects how your content ranks within the feed.

16,"I've had a public IG profile of my **Nissan GTR** ([https://www.instagram.com/gwynethbluepearl/](https://www.instagram.com/gwynethbluepearl/)) and have always been very active for 3 years. I used to live in the US so most of my followers from the US. I would usually post twice per day on what I found the peak times around 7:00 am or 4-5 pm (-5 EST). When I did, I used to get at least 400-500 likes per post and my followers were increasing rapidly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved back home last year, different timezone, GMT +3, 8 hrs ahead of US time. However, I continued posting on US time as usual. Within the last 3-4 months likes have decreased. I've heard about the new IG algorithm could be messing up or ghosting my profile. So i checked another public profile I had (not following my car page) and checked one of the hashtags I used. It does appear, meaning im not shadow-banned.

&amp;#x200B;

I use my hashtags in the comment section, all related to my content, nothing like #love etc.. I heard limiting to 10 is better than 30. So i did.. no change.. then went back to 30 saw a bit of improvement, but not like how it used to be.

I know the title is very ""LOOK AT ME I'M SUCCESSFUL"" but that's not my intention with this posting.

I'm going to run through a little on my day to day tasks and how I landed my clients to pay me a high-ticket sales price on marketing services towards their social media profiles.

First things first, a little about what I do.

Instagram &amp; Social Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc have shadow algorithms that put content in-front of the right viewer. In Instagram's case, they're studying your liking history, your explore page clicks, hashtags you frequent or websites you've visited in the past (Facebook pixel tracking).

This information is then passed through an algorithm that categorizes you into a specific viewer description.

For example if you spend all your time watching Tai Lopez video's on YouTube and convert to his Facebook page, you will be bombarded with advertisements or content featuring Entrepreneurs, Hustling or just general business pages on Instagram.

Now this is where my marketing brand comes into play. I charge my clients between $2000-$5000 per month to categorize them into their selected audience that they want to capitalize off of. For instance, if you're selling an Online Course, I need to get your content in-front of people who have seen online courses without using traditional marketing methods such as paying for advertisements (Low ROI).

The way I do this is by artificially pushing the shadow algorithm to make your profile appear more popular then you really are. Categorizing you with the best of the best in the selected industry, and putting you infront of the people the industry leaders spent their marketing budget on. Essentially finessing their paid audience and putting you as a candidate for their target audience.

Not only has this worked for my clients (Average ROI is x13 where traditional marketing is around x2.5). But It has worked for my marketing company as well. With no advertisements, just cold approach via DM and a couple clients of mine who have achieved ""Verified"" status on Instagram utilizing this algorithm growth hack, all of my clients have generally been from word of mouth.

Being able to grow an account from 2000 followers to 50,000 followers in a month may seem like a piece of cake to alot of people. ""Oh, you just go on Fiverr and buy fake follows and you're set"". WRONG. Your account will be flagged and the followers will be removed. Instagram's algorithm has changed quite a bit over the last year and they're onto fake/botted accounts.

So what's the loophole around this shadow banning algorithm? Slow, steady, targeted growth. Growing an account from 2000 followers (as an example) to 50,000 will take 60 days. Posting frequently and increasing engagement, profile views and story views along the process. Not only does this protect your account from the bot tracing algorithm, but it will put your account into the ""recommended"" section for the selected industry you're exhibiting with your content (Hashtags for targeting).

So why am I making this post? I'm making this post to let you know that the people you may perceive as successful and those who have a huge audience may not be as big as they appear. Keep an eye out for genuine content and people who can showcase more then wealth in the Entrepreneurship industry. My wealthiest clients have no issue cutting me $5000 per month to grow their social media because I bring them high ticket clients using these techniques. If you're somebody out there who wants to learn more about how I grow accounts, or how you can get started don't hesitate to message me on Reddit.

I'll get back to each and every one of you.

It will take a few weeks. However, you can use it to determine the best days to post on Instagram based on your target audience, along with the times that work best for getting more engagement on those particular days.

## Best times to post on Instagram based on older research reports

The more recent researches have shown that the best times to post on Instagram are:

* **12:00 am, 3:00 pm, and 4:00 pm:** Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were the best days to post. Posting in the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. during off hours could work to your advantage because people are still scrolling on their feeds.
* **5:00 am:** This time showed surprisingly good results in reports, maybe because posts this early catch that early birds who check their phone the first thing after waking up.
* **7:00 am ‚Äì 9:00 am:** Morning is a good time to post because people are just waking up. Most users can‚Äôt resist checking their phones to find out what they missed while sleeping. After 9:00 am, however, you may notice a bit of a drop in engagement due to school and regular work hours.
* **11:00 am ‚Äì 2:00 pm:** Around the lunchtime is when users find time to check their phones; that often includes checking Instagram and other social media platforms.
* **3:00 pm ‚Äì 4:00 pm:** Everyone is just going home from school or work. They‚Äôre probably checking their Instagram to help pass the
* **5:00 pm ‚Äì 7:00 pm:** After work and school, people get the opportunity to relax. They may start checking their Instagram while they sit on the bus or in front of the TV just before their dinnertime. Remember you may be better off posting earlier around 5:00 pm or later at 7:00 pm instead of right in the middle when many people are driving home from work or eating dinner.

&gt;**Over the past year, we have been researching Instagram algorithm and growth methods to reach organic followers and engagement, and I taught a lot of my findings from teenagers managing accounts with millions of followers.**

In this article, I am going to show you how to grow your impressions on Instagram. Are you ready for your Insta-growth? So here we go.

### Instagram Is A Search Engine

You should think of Instagram as a search engine like google and yahoo. Users are continually searching for content based on keywords (hashtags). Instagram‚Äôs logic is similar to Google, but instead of using keywords, they use #hashtags. So users search for things they want by using #hashtags.

### Being At The Top Post Section

When you search something like #memes on Instagram, you will see top posts (posts with the highest engagements) at the top of your search results. This is where you want to get your posts. If you take a look upon the top posts, they all have the highest amount of engagements. The accounts from the top posts are getting a firehouse for followers interested in memes.

###### Shout-Out 4 Shout-Out

Also known as SFS, this is a shortcut for growing organically on Instagram. SFS means you repost someone‚Äôs content on your Instagram asking your followers to follow them, and the other person does the same for you. There is a method to help with getting users to do this for you for free.

Note! To get these reposts for free, you should only reach people the same ‚Äúsize‚Äù as you. For example, if you have 20K followers, you can only ask people with 20k followers for a shout-out.

###### Short-Term Paid Shout-Outs

This is how influencers make money on Instagram. If you reach an influencer in your industry for a shout-out, they may charge you Hourly. That‚Äôs right, hourly! On average an influencer with 1-4 million followers will charge $100 or $200 for every our they keep your promotion up on their profile.

### Long-Term Paid Ads

These are the goal for every **brand on Instagram**. Once an ad is posted on someone else‚Äôs Instagram account with your @username, that works like a ‚Äúfollower funnel.‚Äù. Just like the traditional SEO method in **digital marketing** called ‚Äúbuying backlinks.‚Äù

### Daily Promotion Plan

* An hour per day for sharing content.
* 3-4 posts max per day
* Consistent hashtags per post
* Send one ‚ÄúDirect message‚Äù to another user, per day.
* One or two hours engaging with your followers and your target audience

Tips: Millions of the people‚Äôs daily use the Instagram and it is the best opportunity to sky your business into the sky by using Instagram Service.

## 5. Use The High Quality Images

üì∑

A case study show If you put high quality photos in your story, post e.t.c. so you received 2 time more likes to comparison with low quality images.

I think Instagram algorithm reach more audience If you upload the HDR images or PNG images.

Suppose you reach two time more Audience If you upload the High Quality Image so that means you archive the more user‚Äôs and high quality images always attract users to follow your account.

So always try to upload the high quality images in your account so you hit more likes.

For capturing the high quality photos you need to purchase the DSLR Camera or I recommend you to purchase the Canon 200D Camera because it‚Äôs capture awesome images.

## 6. Trying To Adding Filters

üì∑

Instagram provides you the lot‚Äôs of filtering features in your account that means you make your photo more gorgeous by applied the best Filter.

* Moon
* Lark
* Reyes
* Juno
* Slumber
* Crema
* Ludwig
* Aden
* Perpetua
* Amaro
* Mayfair
* Rise
* Hudson e.t.c.

You can easily apply anyone best filter easily so always upload your image by using the anyone filter.

## 7. Create Your Image Awesome

üì∑

Why people‚Äôs follow the accounts? You know? because If he looking your image great but some people‚Äôs make mistake because he can‚Äôt publish the best picture that why no body follow him.

You need to modify your images, videos If you are not celebrate.

If you are the mobile user (most of the people‚Äôs use the mobile device) so we recommend you to download these apps to make your images great.

* [Canva](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor)
* [Pics Art](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio)

Sunday is the holiday and millions of people are not busy in the work and he only running social media profiles that why you received the more likes so I recommend you to always try to upload the more Photos on Sunday.

&gt;Instagram is cleaning up its hashtags. You may notice that some hashtags don‚Äôt work anymore. So it‚Äôs a sign that they can get your Instagram account in trouble if you use them. Some hashtags can even get your account blocked on Instagram!

https://i.redd.it/z2fkio1l62y11.png

**What should I do to avoid getting banned by using a hashtag?**

* check the hashtags before you use them in your caption.
* Avoid using banned Instagram hashtags.
* Some hashtags are using as spams with inappropriate content like nudity. Therefore, Instagram is going to block those hashtags.
* Banned hashtags can be as ridiculous as #desk or #thought or #skype.
* Some of them are banned temporarily, others indefinitely.

It seems reasonable to avoid using banned hashtags on Instagram. Because who knows what is going on with the **Instagram algorithm** at the moment?

If you have been following the articles on our site, you will know about this thing called ‚Äúthe Instagram shadowban.‚Äù

Hashtags are playing a significant role in this. They are one of the reasons why you stop getting likes, followers, comments and engagements on Instagram.

Why? Because Instagram will make you ‚Äúinvisible.‚Äù so Your whole hashtag section won‚Äôt work anymore.

So it‚Äôs better if you stop this from happening before it‚Äôs too late.

**There are a few ways to check if a hashtag is blocked or banned on Instagram:**

###### 1-¬† Search the hashtag on Instagram

You should follow these steps if you want to find out if a hashtag is blocked on Instagram:

* **Go to your explore page (the magnifying glass button)**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yuutvuvl62y11.png

* **Type the hashtag in the search bar**
* **If it doesn‚Äôt appear in the search results, you would know that the hashtag is banned by Instagram.**

Note! The hashtag could be blocked temporarily or indefinitely. This means that one day it might be back from being blocked.

https://i.redd.it/9h7143dm62y11.png

* If it appears in the search result, tap on it. You should make sure it has not been banned. Sometimes they will show up on the search results but they link to a broken page.

https://i.redd.it/tej66e1n62y11.png

###### 2-¬† Search the hashtag in a third party app

If you are using the preview app:

* Go to the caption section.
* Type your specific hashtag.
* If it does not appear in the search result, you
* shouldn‚Äôt use it.

**More advices:**

* Search the hashtag before using them.
* Save your safe hashtags somewhere to re-use them anytime you want.
* Use specific community hashtags
* Put them in the captions and not in the comments.

I might get hate on this thread because there are several Instagram automation service providers on here and I'm about to talk on why automation is the worst way to grow your account. 

**Why you need to stop botting**

You are hurting your Instagram account very badly if you continue to follow/unfollow and bot. Basically, you are forcing people to make a decision by engaging them first. Let's take an example: 

Let's say you have an account in the dentist niche. You start growing your account by following people who have liked the most recent post of a large dentist account. Great! You get most of them to follow you back. But are they highly active and engaging with your Instagram account? Do you think they will begin to fall in love with your Instagram account, or continue to stay active and engaging with the large dentist account they already follow for a while? 

98% of the times (this is based on my years of experience) these users are only following you back out of friendliness or the fact that they don't usually get friend requests from public pages so it's a ""big thing"" for them. 2% of the times, they are interested in your business. But here's the fun part: the 2% that's interested in your business drops down to 0.1% because they sense all this lame Instagram automation going on in your account! Do you have posts that have comments like these: ""Amazing content!"" ""Really good post. check out my page"" ""Hey amazing content check out my content and give me a follow!"" Basically general comments and nothing specific to your post? 

These guys have automated comments running on Instagram and are liking posts that have certain hashtags in them. A total turn off for a real, potential customer. And by the way, hashtags are totally worthless on Instagram today (unless you are geotagging). I could do a whole other post on this, but that's for later. 

**Botting isn't TOTALLY worthless**

If you have the patience to wait out a year (or more) until you actually start getting a mix of good followers + bad followers, then botting isn't worthless. You need to automate your Instagram account to atleast 75k followers and post highly engaging content. When you do reach 75k or higher, your engagement will still not be up to par because of all the bad followers you forced to follow you.

In reality, botting is A BIT better than just buying fake followers. This is true! The only difference is, fake followers give you 0 activity while forced followers give you a bit more. 

Botting/Automation is only for people who are focused on spam marketing. If you own a 100 spam accounts with 100 different proxies and are spamming affiliate links every hour or so, then automation is for you. I wouldn't rely on Instagram as the platform for this sort of marketing for too long though. You need to be exceptionally cautious and experienced to avoid getting your accounts banned on a regular basis. 

My Instagram Service

Back to me. I sold my business, Instagram automation, and now focus solely on manual Instagram growth. I have had several clients who have hit ""Explore"" on Instagram where their posts have gone viral and they have gained thousands of followers naturally. In fact, on automation, I used to grab 10,000 followers in 3-4 months. 

Now, with my natural marketing methods, I've had a couple of clients gain over 35,000 followers in just over a month, regardless of how many followers they had. :)

**What I've learned is this:** 

High quality content + Timing + Natural Posting + Engagement Groups + Network Influencers + Good Understanding of Instagram's Algorithm = High quality, explosive growth on Instagram. 

Why did I rant? I am not selling my Instagram service nor do I intend to (I already have many clients who used my automation service hopping on to this service at a much higher price), but after years of learning Instagram (one of the biggest goldmine platforms today) I have come to realization how bad automation is compared to gaining followers more naturally.",,Entrepreneur,"""Instagram's algorithm""",1541775311,Don't automate or bot your Instagram account!,2018-11-09 14:55:11,sensemaking,sensemaking ,sensemaking

&gt;From SEO to social media, algorithms are usually what determine who actually sees the content you post and who does not.  
As the algorithm changes, yesterday‚Äôs marketing strategies might become less efficient tomorrow. That‚Äôs why your policy on each social media platform needs to change as the algorithm changes.

On Instagram just posting on a consistent basis with the right hashtags won‚Äôt necessarily ensure that your content will always reach its expected audience.

Instead, you should consider how you can work with the new algorithm to ease your way to a better **Instagram marketing**.

**How does the new Instagram algorithm work?**

The new **Instagram algorithm** manages the order of the posts that Instagram users see when they are scrolling through their feed.

Based on particular signs, it prioritizes posts, driving the most relevant posts to the top and giving them the most visibility, while other contents are being placed further down in one‚Äôs feed.

These three factors can help you find out about your Instagram strategy:

* **Relationship with the user:**

If a user has interacted with a lot of your past posts, they will be more likely to see your future posts. Users interest This factor is based on whether the user engages with other related posts and accounts. Users who also interact with similar niche are more likely to see your own posts.

* **Recency of the post:**

More recent posts will be pushed to the top of the feed, while older posts will show up further down.

There were also more general points that Instagram shared, which you can make a note of:

* If users follow a lot of accounts, you will face more competition for the top place in their feed.
* Business profiles on Instagram are instantly at a disadvantage in terms of organic reach compared to individual accounts.

Now, you might be thinking what all this have to do with your Instagram marketing strategy.

So let‚Äôs take a look at the ways you can change your approach to reach more of your consumers.

**Build up a better relationship with your audience**

customer loyalty and constant engagement from your followers is now more critical than ever because it can get you on top of their feeds.

**how to create a better relationship with your audience**

* Try to encourage your followers to share their ideas and find an opportunity to start a conversation with them.
* Share User-generated content about your business that your audience has posted. This not only causes more UGC, but followers may tag you in their posts and further increase your digital trace on Instagram.
* Use Engagement-building contests, like tag-a-friend posts or Instagram contests that encourage people to comment.

**Post when your followers are online**

As, RECENCY is a factor in where your post ends up in your followers‚Äô feeds, use it to your advantage. This will show Instagram that it‚Äôs a content that more of your followers would want to see.

To get the maximum engagement of every post, try to post your content during your peak posting times.

Finding your peak posting times may take a little time and effort, you can start by using your Instagram Analytics report, available to all Business accounts in the mobile app.

If you tap on the Audience tab in your Insights and scroll all the way down, you will see a section showing you when your followers are mostly online. You can view this information by days of the week or by the hour on every day.

&amp;#x200B;

You should test out specific posting times to see what actually works best for you. Maybe posting right before a big wave of activity will work best for your brand, or perhaps it‚Äôs better to post right after a wave starts.

**Respond to comments ASAP**

Have you noticed the business profiles who respond to as many comments as possible on Instagram?

This produces social proof for your content, increasing your comment numbers while also encouraging more replies. But it also increases your chances of gaining more engagement while your post‚Äôs potential reach is at its top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Use hashtags to reach new active users**

Hashtags can help you extend your reach by helping you show up in related searches.

For this method to be effective, you need to choose the hashtags that your target audience would search through to discover content and new users.

This is where you will get views that can lead to clicks through to your Instagram profile, engagement, and probably new followers.

**Use Stories to get attention**

**Instagram Stories** draw a lot of attention because they are not controlled by the same algorithm as posts in your feed. They are also an excellent way to interact with your followers and create loyalty, resulting in more engagement on your Instagram posts, and more reach.

**There are many ways you can use stories:**

* Add hashtag stickers with your branded hashtag. When users tap on the sticker, they will be taken to a page of posts using that hashtag, whether they are your own, customer posts or both.
* Share Stories from other accounts. Instagram allows you to share others‚Äô Story directly to your own. You can even encourage your followers to share one of your posts to their Story.
* Encourage engagement with interactive stickers. Such as poll stickers, the emoji slider, and question stickers. This provides you with even more content that your followers might engage with.

**Conclusion**

If you like to get the most out of your Instagram, it isn‚Äôt enough to focus only on publishing content regularly. You should also focus on overall relationship building while engaging with followers from outside of your posts and on them.

Instagram algorithm will always be likely to change. But if you‚Äôre prepared to change with them, you‚Äôll find unexpected new ways to reach your potential audience.

Must have 2500+ followers (*No fake accounts with fake followers - only accounts with genuine content)*

You are an influencer, photographer, videographer, lifestyle traveler, or model.

You are active and can **comment** and like posts every day

What is Instagram DM Group | Pod | Engagement Group?

Instagram Pod is a group of people dedicated to liking and commenting on each others‚Äô photos, in hopes of creating engagement and ranking favorably within the algorithm. Pods are intended to help each other gain more visibility in the Instagram algorithm because if a recently posted photo is getting lots of engagement (likes, and comments with more than four words, and not a series of emojis), chances are it‚Äôll rank favorably in the algorithm.

Rules for our pod:

When you post a picture, send it as DM to our group chat in instagram.

Everybody as soon as they can need to go to this photo, like it and necessarily comment it with 4 or more words (comments matter most for instagram algorithms)

If possible, try to reply back to comments from pod members further adding to your comment count.

If you miss someones post, be sure to comment it as soon as possible.

Be gentle and work as a team.

It is very important to follow these rules, especially about commenting with 4 or more words.

If you are interested drop your Instagram username down below!

27,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with a write up from one of my favorite founders.

Mat Hofma started [Mini Materials](https://www.starterstory.com/mini-materials), a brand that makes $17k/month selling miniature construction supplies.

---

We are Mat Hofma and Erik Polumbo - owners of [Mini Materials](https://www.minimaterials.com/).  We shared our business previously on Starter Story about how we came up with the concept of Mini Materials and how we‚Äôve grown to where we are today selling realistic miniature building supplies worldwide.  

We are back again to discuss a part of our business that we really enjoy.  We, along with Alli Goldwag, our social media guru on staff, put a lot of effort and time into social media marketing with a major focus on Instagram.

We were offered to discuss this topic by Pat and felt it came at a good time as we just recently eclipsed 50k followers.  Here is some background on why we focus a lot of energy into Instagram and how we do it effectively and efficiently.

### Why we focus on Instagram

Our products photograph very well. They are easily recognizable to most people and when we add something for scale that is also obvious like a pencil or a banana or a human hand, it makes for a really catchy picture.

[What our product looks like](https://res.cloudinary.com/starter-story/image/upload/q_auto:low/pfiaahl0xaop7ecgycvs.png)

This gets reactions and creates engagement. Instagram thrives on this, more than any other social media platform.  So for us, Instagram has always been our main focus as far as social media.

**Testing out new ideas**

As we continue to grow as a business and debut new products or try out new scales, we can pitch it first to our followership to get some feedback.  And when we bring out a new product and showcase it on a post, it generates immediate action.  

That‚Äôs comforting, not only are we getting some guidance from our customer base, but we typically get treated well when we hit the mark on a new product.

### Our journey with Instagram

We started the [@MiniMaterials](https://www.instagram.com/minimaterials/) account when we started the business back in March of 2015.  

Growth was slow at first because we didn‚Äôt have the product line built up or a firm branding concept nailed down, so our posts were a bit redundant or rehearsed.  

As we rolled out new products and really started to hone in on who we were reaching out to, our methods started to take shape.

Here are some of our benchmarks in followership:

We opened an account on March 30, 2015. Here‚Äôs what follower growth has looked like:

[A graph of our Instagram growth](https://res.cloudinary.com/starter-story/image/upload/q_auto:low/rpi21dnodarhlnlmioql.png)

We‚Äôre currently adding about 1,000 followers per month.

### Our content schedule

It‚Äôs a lot of work so we try to keep a schedule, albeit loose at times, but we do our best to use it as a framework for how we post throughout the week.  

Here‚Äôs what a typical week looks like:

**Monday**

On Mondays we like to feature other miniature artists and hobbyist, we call it ‚ÄúMini Maker Monday‚Äù.

This cross-markets the featured maker as well as opens their audience to us and others in the miniature community. We‚Äôve found that Instagram accounts that focus on a community tend to be the most successful.

It gets others excited when they see that their products/services or talents are being featured on another account, especially one with a large following. Our friend Kate at @DailyMini is a perfect example of how a community can build your success as well as others.

**Tuesday**

Tuesdays we call ‚ÄúTiny Tuesdays‚Äù, and we try and stick with simple and catchy tiny items that we sell or have created with our products.  

This helps to answer the common customer question, ‚ÄúWhat can you do with these things?‚Äù.

**Wednesday**

Wednesdays are for woodworking. Woodwork, in general, is very catchy and performs well on Instagram, but serve up some realistic miniature versions and it really gets people going. Here‚Äôs an example:

[Example of our woodwork](https://res.cloudinary.com/starter-story/image/upload/q_auto:low/gibuw4uy3mtkdgugodal.png)

**Thursday**

Thursdays we generally go with a ‚ÄúThrowback Thursday‚Äù post to some of our more popular creations.

**Friday through Sunday**

Friday through Sunday are free range. Sometimes we list new products, sales, or giveaways but we try and be more creative than *salesy*.

### Instagram best practices

**Engaging with other accounts**

To get engagement you must also engage with other accounts. Luckily for us, we have three users on the Mini Materials account, so one of us is always active.  

We reach out to accounts that are similar in nature to collaborate on ideas, posts, and shared experiences. The world of miniatures is far larger than you may think and again it photographs really well so there are several big accounts on Instagram that we can collaborate with.

This works both ways for us, we love working with bigger accounts like [@DailyMini](https://www.instagram.com/dailymini/?hl=en), [@TinyDoorsATL](https://www.instagram.com/tinydoorsatl/?hl=en), and [@Guldies](https://www.instagram.com/guldies/?hl=en) because their exposure and reach are great, but also being able to return the favor by boosting smaller accounts is important for our mini community.  

**Post once a day**

Posting once a day is about our limit, it either will get too redundant or too spammy and probably does more harm than good.

However, we have realized that you want to keep your customers engaged by posting with some form of consistency.

**Best practices are always changing**

Since the Instagram algorithm changes somewhat regularly, we have to make sure to keep up with the most up-to-date best practices which require trial and error.  For instance, the previous chronological feed was much easier for accounts to get positive engagement provided they posted on a regular basis, but now the algorithm seeks out the most engaging posts and keeps them at the top or higher up.  So it‚Äôs imperative you have strong hashtags and post at a time when you are more likely to have active followers that will engage with your post.  But, Instagram is always ‚Äúimproving‚Äù so it seems as soon as we seem to figure it out, something changes and we have to tinker again.

### What we‚Äôve learned

**Don‚Äôt put text on images**

When posting about a sale or promotion, we steer clear of using any words on the actual image itself, it comes off too much like a sales pitch. Instead, using a visually appealing content photo with a catchy caption works best.

**Don‚Äôt use hashtags in the caption itself**

Since you can link your post directly to Facebook simultaneously from Instagram, we have seen that forgoing hashtags in the caption tend to be more successful.

After we post, we will use the comments area for relevant hashtags. Keep away from using irrelevant hashtags. There are apps available like Plann that will provide some clues on the best hashtags to use.

**Change up your hashtags**

Mixing up hashtags and geotags increases the potential for new followers and engagement across the platform. Using the same hashtags every post gets stale and statistically railroads even the best posts. We use the [Plann App](https://www.plannthat.com/) for researching hashtags.

**Do giveaways**

Giveaways always do well for us. We can grow our followership and get positive engagement that can keep us in the spotlight for a few days.  We typically post a picture of what we are offering to give away and require they like, comment, and tag a friend.  They can do that as much as they‚Äôd like so the post gets plenty of engagement.  We hope the followers tag their friends that do not follow us yet, so we also get new followers (or customers).

The key is, you must actually pick a winner and send the gift out (far too many businesses act like they give product away for account growth but rarely do).  

### Getting started with Instagram

We have noticed, and have read, that businesses that have recently joined Instagram are having a harder time building their follower base. This is very unfortunate because Instagram is a major social media source for us and we know the benefits that stem from this platform.

Our recommendation would be to stay with it, research and keep up with the algorithm changes, maintain consistency with your branding, and make sure your content is visually appealing for your followers.

Contact bigger accounts that have some similarities, and ask for feature posts - this may cost a bit but it can easily be worth it if your content is engaging. You can offer to send product for unboxing videos or promoted feedback, and this can do wonders for you.  But also, be open to criticism.

Quick timeline of my account (message me if you want to see the account; didn't want to promote here):

**August 2016**: created account

**December 2016**: 10k followers; average post gets 600-1000 likes.

**Feb 2017**: Life started getting busy; started posting less. Account stopped growing unless I followed people in hopes they would follow back.

**April 2017:** last post until April of 2018. 10.4k followers. Average reach around 3.5k

**April 2018**: Started account again, 9.2k followers, average post gets 400-500 likes. Quit posting after about a week.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Does getting engaged by popular accounts improve your own engagement? For example an account with 10k followers compared to 1k. Also what determines a popular account? Follower number or engagement? (for example some accounts have atrocious engagement rates probably because of bots).

&amp;#x200B;

3) Is it best to always use 30 hashtags or change it between 25 to 30? Also does tagging feature pages (I do photography) on your post effective?

&amp;#x200B;

4) Has anyone re-tested the IG algorithm but with more controlled variables? For example a post I thought would be my best &amp; creative only received 550 likes where most of the likes were in-house. I'm going to re-post it in the future with a slightly different edit to see how it fares again.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Does commenting on bigger pages have any affect on your results (for example 100k+) where the probability of them checking your own stuff is basically 0%? I see a lot of people do this and I'm wondering if it's just a waste of time?

45,"Contesting on social networks has different approaches, but the main purpose that brands follow from the competition in Instagram and other social networks is to attract the audience, gain customer satisfaction and increase the rate of engaging posts.

‚Äã

**What is the meaning of holding a contest on Instagram?**

Recently, pages with large amount of followers have been publishing posts for the contest to attract audiences, obtain customer satisfaction and increase the engagement rate. The contest is usually such that brands require audiences to create a specific campaign for brand advertising. They do this and in return for that particular brand, they will give them a lottery or a gift, of course, these gifts are usually of the same branded products.

‚Äã

**How to hold an Instagram lottery?**

Naturally, the question will come to you about how these brands make a lottery and how they choose the winners. In answer to the possible question, we have to say there are tools that will do this for you easily. The way these tools work is that you enter the post of the contest and the number of winners and then they will select a number of comments randomly and you select these as winners. That‚Äôs why holding a contest is easy.

Of course, in some cases when people have to mention one or more of their friends, given the possibility of cheating people and to prevent them, you must validate their comments after selecting the winners, and remove those who cheat from winners. And again, through these tools, choose the same number of new winning cheaters and continue the screening to the extent that the number of these reaches zero until the actual winners are selected.

One of these tools is the [Commentpicker](https://commentpicker.com) website, which is one of the best websites to make a lottery on Instagram.

‚Äã

**What are the advantage of holding an Instagram contest?**

Holding these matches, if targeted &amp; correct, will have good results for brands.A number of advantages of contest:

* In some of these contests, users are prompted to mention a few of their friends under the post, which will make new people familiar with your brand, which has a significant impact on awareness raising for your brand.
* By holding contest and awarding your followers, they will feel better about your brand, and if you do this continually, people will follow your Instagram page more than ever.
* In these contests according to the Instagram algorithm, with the increase in the rate of engagement due to increase in the number of comments, your post will be shown to more people and therefore it is more likely to reach the explore page and become [viral](http://bit.ly/2Nhgilz).

Depend on your audiences, different hours can be golden times for publishing your posts. In the following, we will describe the best hours for publishing content on Instagram, of course these hours will not satisfy to all pages essentially and you should choose the right time by knowing your audiences.

* In the morning (8am ‚Äì 10 am)

This period of time as it is the first hours of the day, people publicly check their Instagram home for the first time and that‚Äôs why it is so important.

* In the afternoon (16:30pm ‚Äì 19 pm)

This period, as it is immediately the end of hours of work time, the possible of published posts being attracted by audiences will be higher.

* In the Midnight (22pm ‚Äì 1 am)

Finally the last period of time will be midnight. In these hours, people often check their social media before going to sleep and that‚Äôs why it is the golden time.There are some tools made for more convenience when posting on Instagram that help users to post by schedule in order not to lose any of the periods mentioned above.The most important of these tools made for Instagram platform because the need for [Instagram post schedule](https://buffer.com/) tool is felt more on the Instagram.

Pods are intended to help each other gain more visibility in the Instagram algorithm because if a recently posted photo is getting lots of engagement (likes, and comments with more than four words, and not a series of emojis), chances are it‚Äôll rank favorably in the algorithm.

Rules for our pod:

When you post a picture, send it as DM to our group chat in instagram.

Everybody as soon as they can need to go to this photo, like it and necessarily comment it with 4 or more (!) words (comments matter most for instagram algorithms)

If possible, try to reply back to comments from pod members further adding to your comment count.

If you miss someones post, be sure to comment it as soon as possible.

Be gentle and work as a team.

It is very important to follow these rules, especially about commenting with 4 or more words.

10,"Hello! I run a social media marketing agency, but I've specialized in Instagram management for the past 2-3 years and currently my prime focus is Instagram management. 


One thing I've noticed is the rising demand for automating your Instagram account. This is done by purchasing a bot, such as Massplanner or Followliker, and automating your Instagram account to follow, unfollow, like, comment and DM people automatically. Many people also choose to do this manually which is also a no no.


No offence to all the businesses who sell Instagram automation services, but the reason this method of growing your account is so full of sh*t is because you are forcing people to follow you, out of their will. 


For example, your account is in the cars niche and you decide to follow a bunch of people who liked a recent post by a huge cars account. Chances are pretty high that people who are already interested in car pages will follow your page as well. But guess what? Are they more willing to interact with an extremely large car page or yours?


There's a 90% chance that they are only following you back out of respect, courtesy, or the fact that not many pages send them a follow request so it's a ""big thing"" for them. You are forcing them to make a decision to follow you by engaging them first.


Out of my years of experience in the Instagram game, these followers are the least engaging, unless you post out-of-the-world unique content which catches their eye. But even then, there will be a large account already posting such content and you will most likely be overshadowed. 


**Botting your way to Instagram growth is SLIGHTLY better than just going ahead and buying fake followers.** Period! The only difference is that fake followers never like your posts and there is no activity, where as the botted/forced followers may like your post once in a blue moon. 


**What 99% of people fail to realize is that Instagram isn't about the having the highest number of followers, it's about having the highest engagement!** A 100k page which has 0 activity will grow extremely slow and not grab as much attention as a booming 5000-follower page with 2,000 likes and 25 comments per post.


By the way, I forgot to mention this: Posting the same 20-30 hashtags repeatedly in every single post gets you shadowbanned. **Hashtags are absolutely worthless (unless you are geotagging) when it comes to growing your account and I could write a whole other post regarding them.** 

Let's say your automated account does get engagement and you have a post which gets a lot of likes and comments. Are the comments saying ""Amazing content!"" ""Lovely post!"" ""Love your posts, would love to get in touch with you!"" ""You have great content"" Basically a general comment and nothing specific to your post? Well guess what, those guys are running automation just as you are! They are commenting on posts which have specific hashtags and are commenting on posts just like yours so other people see them. **The real, natural users of Instagram, aka potential consumers, can sense Instagram automation a mile away!** 


I am not saying that botting your account will get you 0 sales or 0 good followers. **But I am definitely saying 99% of your followers are worthless.** 

The only time I recommend you follow people to try and getting them follow you back, is if you are a brand new account with 0 followers. You can do this to gain about 3 to 4 thousand followers at best so you have something to start out on. However, even then it's not needed if you can get in to a network of influencers and engagement groups or you understand how viral marketing on Instagram works. 


Trust me guys, I have used automation for several clients the past few years and I've gotten them to 10,000, not-so-engaging followers within 2-3 months. 


I now only market and manage Instagram accounts via engagement groups, network influencing and adapting to Instagram's algorithms. This has helped me land a few clients on the 'Explore' page of Instagram, helped their content go viral, and attract much, much more followers naturally.

Last summer, I started a car page featuring my car. I started as a personal page just for fun because cars are a hobby of mine and I love my car (a Dodge Challenger) and the Dodge Brand. I began adding people who had the same car then eventually branched out to other car makes. By December/January, I had over 1k active followers (more than my personal page which I've had for 5 years) and would average 150-200+ likes per post. I wasn't until about February that I decided to turn my account into a business page because I thought the idea of seeing my analytics would be awesome. 

Things were fine for a while...then I started noticing activity decline. Likes began to average out around 50-100+ and followers slowed down as well. I noticed when looking at the ""found by a Hashtag"" count that I'd only have been seen my 1 or 2 people. Impressions and Reach began to falter too. 

I know IG recently changed how the whole algorithm thing works as far as posts being seen first depending on how many likes and comments a poster gets but I had also found out about the Shadowbans and banned hashtags and began wondering if my account had fallen victim to something like that. I even began to wonder if turning it into a business account had something to do with it.

Instagram has released a new feature on the story stickers that lets you ask a question from all of your followers a great Q&amp;A (question and answer) sticker. You can ask your followers for questions and then share them selectively and reply to them on another story.

The benefits of this new feature?

This could be very useful for the influencers on Instagram who have a lot of curious fans. They would love to find out more about their role model.

It is more appropriate than sending a DM.

You can see all the responses while others cannot so this is more unique than the usual commenting situation on a post and there is a lot less potential for the thing to go wrong.

Your followers can answer a question as many times as they like.

If you are running a business account, you can use it to ask for feedback.

You can ask them to ask you a question, and then you can respond to the question by sharing their responses to your next story and replying to the question there.

It will bring you a serious engagement rate.

You can share the responses with your followers, and the name of the user would not appear.

Although this feature is not anonymous ( if you reply the question the original poster will know it‚Äôs from you ) but still, it can be a good tool for anyone who is trying to get more attention from their followers.

It‚Äôs a good way to interact directly with fans, or host AMA (ask me anything) sessions, that currently is happening by live stories.

What is the difference between Question sticker and the poll stickers?

With the poll sticker your followers can only choose their answer between two default answers that you write, but with the Q&amp;A sticker, they can write whatever they want to answer your question.

How to use the question sticker on our story?

1- Open Instagram‚Äôs story camera and take a photo or a video ( you can also select one from your phone (tap the gallery button at the bottom right of your screen)

2- Tap the sticker button, tap the questions sticker and locate them wherever you want.

3- Now tap anywhere on the sticker to start typing your question. This would be the question that your followers will see and answer it.

Note! You can change the color of the sticker by choosing one of the colors showing below it.

4- Tap did if you‚Äôre finished, and now you can reposition or resize the sticker however you want to.

What does it look like for my followers?

This is very easy; When your followers want to answer your question with the sticker, they should tap ‚ÄúType something‚Ä¶‚Äù tab to answer your question then they should press ‚ÄúSend.‚Äù

You can share their responses anonymously on another story!

You can share the responses you have got in a new story.

Here I'll post a few of the activities/variables of Instagram with some tips related to them, for making the most out of certain aspects of accounts; I'd post it as an article on my website in an attempt at ranking on Google for more clients, but it'll probably give them too much information in return.

# 'Related' and synergy

**Followers**

The followers who engage with your account will expose the posts they like to their own followers via the 'liked &gt; following' feed, one of Instagram's ways of implementing opportunity for virality and community within its own. This allows growth to occur naturally while via proper account grooming methods when applied, and as a way to have an accounts growth to be less random-- less sources more organised sources of exposure--¬†when it does inevitably occur. This has unfortunately, and, naturally (according to the underlying mechanics of anything in this world¬†in action) has created a drip-down theme within the community, which I personally visualise as a pyramid. I make use of this visualisation¬†throughout.

It's the same (less so) for the followers of people who follow a hashtag(s) you use, and (even less so) for those who don't follow you, such as a like from a visitor from direct links, IE from Reddit.¬†Your followers are more likely to like more than one post and, more importantly, to come back and re-expose your account to their followers as you post content they like later on. *Side note, this is due to: An advertisement (the feed in this case being an advertisement/recommendation to ones followers) is less likely to be efficient upon first impression compared to when being viewed multiple times by the person - Source, I think: Global Marketing, Seventh Edition, Warren J. Keegan &amp; Mark C. Green.* ¬†

**The structure is as follows, sorted into the¬†three tiers below.**

People either stop being relevant to tier 1¬†after the third level, or they create¬†a condition in which their objective, should being relevant to these accounts be so, be completed, such as following tier 2 accounts to become tier 3. Another of the¬†alternates for making use of mechanic that (coincidentally) synergises well¬†with the prior mentioned¬†is to receive engagement from accounts on their own tier, reaching through the followings' likes feed-- in which this sections current focus is; there are other methods using other mechanics/features/sources-- the tier below their own¬†to strengthen their position within the community as a T1 account.

You will exist within all three tiers simultaneously and all will be used, depending on your goal. The size of your account dictates your tier within the general niche/community you're a part of, key factors being such as your: followers, reach, engagement, influence. You could be a tier 1 within a community of x accounts, in turn being a tier 2 to the T1 of xx accounts, tier 3 to T1's of xxx accounts. This, leaning more towards likes and like power (the relevance of accounts liking your post, relating to the tight audience you've built) also decides which hashtags you'll reach 'most popular' on.

Being in direct competition with other accounts of the tier, being the 'followings' of the T2 accounts, to further establish yourself as T1 is to 1) have other accounts of your tier¬†engage with your posts, recommending your account¬†to their followers and in turn, a bigger part of the overall community and 2) have T2 accounts follow you and engage with your posts as the¬†T1 accounts did; this reinforcement helps make use of the T3 accounts that will soon be hard to reach and, during your accounts scaling period, inefficient targets for the cost of bringing them to your account. Being established prevents any

**Tier 1** is influencer status within a community, in which all users see your posts either directly or via referrals from¬†feeds,¬†a circle of accounts mutual to each other (also called your follower base or potential reach), tighter but smaller than the community tiers above your own.

Three main factors determine what you see in your Instagram feed:

1. **Interest:** How much Instagram predicts you‚Äôll care about a post, with higher ranking for what matters to you, determined by past behavior on similar content and potentially machine vision analyzing the actual content of the post.
2. **Recency:** How recently the post was shared, with prioritization for timely posts over weeks\-old ones.
3. **Relationship:** How close you are to the person who shared it, with higher ranking for people you‚Äôve interacted with a lot in the past on Instagram, such as by commenting on their posts or being tagged together in photos.

Instagram Algorithm Myths:

* **Chronological Feed Not Coming Back** \- Instagram is not at this time considering an option to see the old reverse chronological feed because it doesn‚Äôt want to add more complexity \(users might forget what feed they‚Äôre set to\), but it is listening to users who dislike the algorithm.
* **Instagram does not hide posts in the feed**, and you‚Äôll see everything posted by everyone you follow if you keep scrolling.
* **Feed ranking does not favor the photo or video format universally**, but people‚Äôs feeds are tuned based on what kind of content they engage with, so if you never stop to watch videos you might see fewer of them.
* **Instagram‚Äôs feed doesn‚Äôt favor users who use Stories, Live**, or other special features of the app.
* **Instagram doesn‚Äôt downrank users for posting too frequently** or for other specific behaviors, but it might swap in other content in between someone‚Äôs if they rapid\-fire separate posts.
* **Instagram doesn‚Äôt give extra feed presence to personal accounts or business accounts**, so switching won‚Äôt help your reach.
* **Shadowbanning is not a real thing**, and Instagram says it doesn‚Äôt hide people‚Äôs content for posting too many hashtags or taking other actions.

Over the years, Instagram has become the new Facebook. Everyone is on Instagram, and brands are caring about the platform. Around 70% off all my social media calls are on Instagram and how brands can leverage the platform more. Instagram won't reveal the intricacies of their algorithm. To learn as much as we can, I picked the brains of Instagram influencers. I have determined there are 5 secrets you 100% must know about.

**Instagram growth doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhappen.‚Äù**

Can we first admit that we want more followers on Instagram? Can we also admit that it is 100% okay to care about ‚Äúvanity metrics.‚Äù Those metrics make us feel good, and also show us that our Instagram account is growing.

Instagram follower growth is important as there is a churn of followers. Some people will stop following you or stop using the platform. We need more people coming in all the time.

Talking to influencers about growth they share their secrets to growth.

According to Instagram Expert Emelina Spinelli‚Äôs Instagram training:[Instagram Expert Emelina Spinelli‚Äôs Instagram training](www.emelinaspinelli.com)


Brand new accounts have two main ways to grow.

The first is creating interesting and engaging content that no one has ever seen before. The challenge with this method is that your content has no initial audience to engage with it.

The second way to grow is also the most tried and true metric of follow/unfollowing. The key to being authentic when you follow/unfollow is to follow those who engage in similar content. Find your niche early on and engage with other people in the niche.

If you are an amazing food stylist, find the top 10 food stylist and follow there most active followers. Once those people follow you, engage with them and build a community. Then you aren‚Äôt going to be inauthentic.

If you also create unique content then you will grow a following top the follow/unfollow game.

**You don‚Äôt gain followers by posting. Quality + Quantity**

Instagram‚Äôs algorithm monitors most likely hundreds of different factors. No one knows for sure exactly how many signal‚Äôs Instagram uses, and Instagram would never tell us all. That said, we have been able to deduce a few key signals that are important.

Authors Notes: The evidence in this article is from my team and I monitoring growth of 100 accounts. All accounts used the follow/unfollow method. Each account was different sizes and niches to generate as broad of a spectrum as possible.

What we determined was that there is a hard cap on the number of daily actions you can perform on Instagram. That number changes when you post more times on Instagram a day.

This makes sense of course and isn‚Äôt a giant revelation. Instagram knows who is active and stops you from spamming follow/unfollow if you aren‚Äôt posting. You look like a spammer if you post only 1 or 2 times a week but follow/unfollow.

What was more exciting, is that Instagram can actually determine quality content. A few accounts that posted only once a week that still generated significant growth. Digging deeper we found why.

Those accounts had 3 common themes.
high levels of community engagement
quality of content
social authority of those accounts.
The net result is that if you want to win the Instagram game, you must have a large quantity of quality content.

**Instagram Algorithm Metrics that Matter**

Different actions on Instagram affect the Instagram algorithm more then others signals. Certain metrics weight more then others in the algorithm. An Instagram like weighs less then a solid comment.

Using this information we can determine what qualifies as quality content. The least valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of content is likes. More likes on a piece of content doesn‚Äôt  mean the content is quality. It is one of many signals.

The most valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of a content are saves. The more saves a piece of content generates the greater the reach the content generates. Content that generates 20 or more saves increased total reach by 2-4k impressions.

This also makes sense, users have been ‚Äúspamming‚Äù likes on a plethora of content. Trying to like more photos to build their audience and get more likes themselves.

Users have saved a lot less photos and thus the value of a save is much higher. The save feature is doesn't send a signal to other users. So people use the tool to save content they actually love.

The other surprising finding is that comments under 3 words have almost no value. Due to in part the massive amount of ‚Äúspam comments.‚Äù Comments that have a couple of emoji‚Äôs or a simple generic message like ‚Äúnice pic.‚Äù

On the flip, Comments that have 4 or more words generate real engagement. These comments actually have a noticeable effect on your Instagram algorithm.

Finally we took a look at the Story feature. There was a massive growth if user created stories and watched other users stories.  Creating stories that actually generate engagement effect your Instagram algorithm as a whole.

The simple breakdown of metrics to measure by least to greatest weight are:

Likes on a photo/video
1 -3 word comments on a photo/video
4+ word comments on a photo/video
Saves per photo/video
Story views
Story watches

What we can deduce is that organic engagement is easy for Instagram to measure. Trying to game the system by spamming tons of likes on a photo through engagement groups is finished.

Trying to build a ‚Äúsave only‚Äù engagement group won‚Äôt work either as it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to identify and adapt to one. Instagram's algorithm is much smarter than you and I.
The focus must be on generating real, quality content that resonates with the audience.

What this means is a real investment must put into your social media content marketing. No more ‚Äúpass it to the intern to handle‚Äù instead, actually spend money on hiring in professionals.

**Instagram Algorithm Comments**

Diving a bit further into comments, Instagram can determine ‚Äúspam‚Äù comments. Instagram does this in two main ways.

The first is the quality of the comment itself. As we stated before the 3 word and under comments are generally ruled as not important and spam. This isn‚Äôt always a hard and fast rule, but as a general rule it holds true.

If you are having a conversation back and forth with a user, 3 words and under can be fine. As the sheer quantity of the comments works in your favor.

When you are leaving comments write real, authentic comments. People will come back and engage with you on your page, leaving real authentic comments.

The other way Instagram determines the quality of the comments is the authority of the commenter. Think of comments like you would ‚Äúbacklinks‚Äù to a website. A comment with low follower count, low quality content, and low engagement is bad for you. The quality of the comment is going to be very low in the algorithm. Compare that to a comment from an influencer or brand. That comment has more value in the algorithm

Instagram ranks yours account as a whole. Determining if you are a spam account that should be shadow band or promoted.

**The FEED is important!**

Look at any big native Instagrammer whos primary revenue comes from Instagram. You will notice a consistent look and feel across every photo and the entire Instagram feed as a whole. This was a simple way of establishing your look and help with your visual branding.

Your feed matters more than you think! Instagrammers who had tighter, more defined feeds also generated more engagement. We determine this to be akin to a ‚Äútime on site‚Äù metric.

The more time a user spends on your account, the more value you are to Instagram. You are increasing their advertising revenue.

This also works in your favor. As users ""spam"" your account with likes and comments. Your old content gets an extra boost in the algorithm and kicks the content into someone else's feed. This gives you a nice little boost of impressions.

Master the feed to master the Instagram game. Find a unique style that wows fans and is native to the niche.

**My assumption about the Instagram Algorithm**

Since I do not work for Instagram or Facebook, my findings and assumptions are not 100% verified. That said, with a little deductive reasoning, you will agree with my assumptions. We know that Facebook owns Instagram. We also know that Facebook‚Äôs business model of using data to sell advertising. See: Cambridge Analytica.

My assumption is that Instagram‚Äôs algorithm is 95-100% the same as Facebooks.

With that knowledge we can treat our content creation and distribution like Facebook.

Let me know what you think, did the findings help you understand Instagram better? Do you think Instagram‚Äôs algorithm is based off Facebooks? Leave a comment with your thoughts and if you like this please share it on social media.

The focus must be on generating real, quality content that resonates with the audience.

What this means is a real investment must put into your social media content marketing. No more ‚Äúpass it to the intern to handle‚Äù instead, actually spend money on hiring in professionals.

**Instagram Algorithm Comments**

Diving a bit further into comments, Instagram can determine ‚Äúspam‚Äù comments. Instagram does this in two main ways.

The first is the quality of the comment itself. As we stated before the 3 word and under comments are generally ruled as not important and spam. This isn‚Äôt always a hard and fast rule, but as a general rule it holds true.

If you are having a conversation back and forth with a user, 3 words and under can be fine. As the sheer quantity of the comments works in your favor.

When you are leaving comments write real, authentic comments. People will come back and engage with you on your page, leaving real authentic comments.

The other way Instagram determines the quality of the comments is the authority of the commenter. Think of comments like you would ‚Äúbacklinks‚Äù to a website. A comment with low follower count, low quality content, and low engagement is bad for you. The quality of the comment is going to be very low in the algorithm. Compare that to a comment from an influencer or brand. That comment has more value in the algorithm

Instagram ranks yours account as a whole. Determining if you are a spam account that should be shadow band or promoted.

**The FEED is important!**

Look at any big native Instagrammer whos primary revenue comes from Instagram. You will notice a consistent look and feel across every photo and the entire Instagram feed as a whole. This was a simple way of establishing your look and help with your visual branding.

Your feed matters more than you think! Instagrammers who had tighter, more defined feeds also generated more engagement. We determine this to be akin to a ‚Äútime on site‚Äù metric.

The more time a user spends on your account, the more value you are to Instagram. You are increasing their advertising revenue.

This also works in your favor. As users ""spam"" your account with likes and comments. Your old content gets an extra boost in the algorithm and kicks the content into someone else's feed. This gives you a nice little boost of impressions.

Master the feed to master the Instagram game. Find a unique style that wows fans and is native to the niche.

**My assumption about the Instagram Algorithm**

Since I do not work for Instagram or Facebook, my findings and assumptions are not 100% verified. That said, with a little deductive reasoning, you will agree with my assumptions. We know that Facebook owns Instagram. We also know that Facebook‚Äôs business model of using data to sell advertising. See: Cambridge Analytica.

My assumption is that Instagram‚Äôs algorithm is 95-100% the same as Facebooks.

With that knowledge we can treat our content creation and distribution like Facebook.

Let me know what you think, did the findings help you understand Instagram better? Do you think Instagram‚Äôs algorithm is based off Facebooks? Leave a comment with your thoughts and if you like this please share it on social media.

I am updating this post as new information just was released. Also changing a link as it broke /r/instagram rules. Hope this fixes it and please upvote if you find this useful.


Over the years, Instagram has become the new Facebook. Everyone is on Instagram, and brands are caring about the platform. Around 70% off all my social media calls are on Instagram and how brands can leverage the platform more. Instagram won't reveal the intricacies of their algorithm. To learn as much as we can, I picked the brains of Instagram influencers. I have determined there are 5 secrets you 100% must know about.

**Instagram growth doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhappen.‚Äù**

Can we first admit that we want more followers on Instagram? Can we also admit that it is 100% okay to care about ‚Äúvanity metrics.‚Äù Those metrics make us feel good, and also show us that our Instagram account is growing.

Instagram follower growth is important as there is a churn of followers. Some people will stop following you or stop using the platform. We need more people coming in all the time.

Talking to influencers about growth they share their secrets to growth.

According to Instagram Expert Emelina Spinelli‚Äôs Instagram training:[Instagram Expert Emelina Spinelli‚Äôs Instagram training](www.emelinaspinelli.com)


Brand new accounts have two main ways to grow.

The first is creating interesting and engaging content that no one has ever seen before. The challenge with this method is that your content has no initial audience to engage with it.

The second way to grow is also the most tried and true metric of follow/unfollowing. The key to being authentic when you follow/unfollow is to follow those who engage in similar content. Find your niche early on and engage with other people in the niche.

If you are an amazing food stylist, find the top 10 food stylist and follow there most active followers. Once those people follow you, engage with them and build a community. Then you aren‚Äôt going to be inauthentic.

If you also create unique content then you will grow a following top the follow/unfollow game.

**You don‚Äôt gain followers by posting. Quality + Quantity**

Instagram‚Äôs algorithm monitors most likely hundreds of different factors. No one knows for sure exactly how many signal‚Äôs Instagram uses, and Instagram would never tell us all. That said, we have been able to deduce a few key signals that are important.

Authors Notes: The evidence in this article is from my team and I monitoring growth of 100 accounts. All accounts used the follow/unfollow method. Each account was different sizes and niches to generate as broad of a spectrum as possible.

What we determined was that there is a hard cap on the number of daily actions you can perform on Instagram. That number changes when you post more times on Instagram a day.

This makes sense of course and isn‚Äôt a giant revelation. Instagram knows who is active and stops you from spamming follow/unfollow if you aren‚Äôt posting. You look like a spammer if you post only 1 or 2 times a week but follow/unfollow.

What was more exciting, is that Instagram can actually determine quality content. A few accounts that posted only once a week that still generated significant growth. Digging deeper we found why.

Those accounts had 3 common themes.
high levels of community engagement
quality of content
social authority of those accounts.
The net result is that if you want to win the Instagram game, you must have a large quantity of quality content.

**Instagram Algorithm Metrics that Matter**

Different actions on Instagram affect the Instagram algorithm more then others signals. Certain metrics weight more then others in the algorithm. An Instagram like weighs less then a solid comment.

Using this information we can determine what qualifies as quality content. The least valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of content is likes. More likes on a piece of content doesn‚Äôt  mean the content is quality. It is one of many signals.

The most valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of a content are saves. The more saves a piece of content generates the greater the reach the content generates. Content that generates 20 or more saves increased total reach by 2-4k impressions.

This also makes sense, users have been ‚Äúspamming‚Äù likes on a plethora of content. Trying to like more photos to build their audience and get more likes themselves.

Users have saved a lot less photos and thus the value of a save is much higher. The save feature is doesn't send a signal to other users. So people use the tool to save content they actually love.

The other surprising finding is that comments under 3 words have almost no value. Due to in part the massive amount of ‚Äúspam comments.‚Äù Comments that have a couple of emoji‚Äôs or a simple generic message like ‚Äúnice pic.‚Äù

On the flip, Comments that have 4 or more words generate real engagement. These comments actually have a noticeable effect on your Instagram algorithm.

Finally we took a look at the Story feature. There was a massive growth if user created stories and watched other users stories.  Creating stories that actually generate engagement effect your Instagram algorithm as a whole.

The simple breakdown of metrics to measure by least to greatest weight are:

Likes on a photo/video
1 -3 word comments on a photo/video
4+ word comments on a photo/video
Saves per photo/video
Story views
Story watches

What we can deduce is that organic engagement is easy for Instagram to measure. Trying to game the system by spamming tons of likes on a photo through engagement groups is finished.

Trying to build a ‚Äúsave only‚Äù engagement group won‚Äôt work either as it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to identify and adapt to one. Instagram's algorithm is much smarter than you and I.
The focus must be on generating real, quality content that resonates with the audience.

What this means is a real investment must put into your social media content marketing. No more ‚Äúpass it to the intern to handle‚Äù instead, actually spend money on hiring in professionals.

I'm getting a little bit fed up about everything that I can read on Instagram Algorithm. I'm not getting as much engagement as I would expect so I tried another strategy...

My goal today is to get engagement and get people to visit my profile. So instead of posting single photo I tried to take advantage of the 3x3 grid and plan a little bit more my posts.

So far I posted 3 series of 3 pictures around one of [my trip in Vietnam](https://www.instagram.com/mariengb44/).

The second way to grow is also the most tried and true metric of follow/unfollowing. The key to being authentic when you follow/unfollow is to follow those who engage in similar content. Find your niche early on and engage with other people in the niche.

  

If you are an amazing food stylist, find the top 10 food stylist and follow there most active followers. Once those people follow you, engage with them and build a community. Then you aren‚Äôt going to be inauthentic.

  

If you also create unique content then you will grow a following top the follow/unfollow game.

  

**You don‚Äôt gain followers by posting. The Key is Quality + Quantity**

  

Instagram‚Äôs algorithm monitors most likely hundreds of different factors. No one knows for sure exactly how many signal‚Äôs Instagram uses, and Instagram would never tell us all. That said, we have been able to deduce a few key signals that are important.

  

Authors Notes: The evidence in this article is from my team and I monitoring growth of 100 accounts. All accounts used the follow/unfollow method. Each account was different sizes and niches to generate as broad of a spectrum as possible.

  

What we determined was that there is a hard cap on the number of daily actions you can perform on Instagram. That number changes when you post more times on Instagram a day.

  

This makes sense of course and isn‚Äôt a giant revelation. Instagram knows who is active and stops you from spamming follow/unfollow if you aren‚Äôt posting. You look like a spammer if you post only 1 or 2 times a week but follow/unfollow.

  

What was more exciting, is that Instagram can actually determine quality content. A few accounts that posted only once a week that still generated significant growth. Digging deeper we found why.

  

Those accounts had 3 common themes.

-   high levels of community engagement
    
-   quality of content
    
-   social authority of those accounts.
    

The net result is that if you want to win the Instagram game, you must have a large quantity of quality content.

  

**Instagram Algorithm Metrics that Matter**

  

Different actions on Instagram affect the Instagram algorithm more then others signals. Certain metrics weight more then others in the algorithm. An Instagram like weighs less then a solid comment.

  

Using this information we can determine what qualifies as quality content. The least valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of content is likes. More likes on a piece of content doesn‚Äôt mean the content is quality. It is one of many signals.

  

The most valuable signal to determine the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of a piece of a content are saves. The more saves a piece of content generates the greater the reach the content generates. Content that generates 20 or more saves increased total reach by 2-4k impressions.

  

This also makes sense, users have been ‚Äúspamming‚Äù likes on a plethora of content. Trying to like more photos to build their audience and get more likes themselves.

  

Users have saved a lot less photos and thus the value of a save is much higher. The save feature is doesn't send a signal to other users. So people use the tool to save content they actually love.

  

The other surprising finding is that comments under 3 words have almost no value. Due to in part the massive amount of ‚Äúspam comments.‚Äù Comments that have a couple of emoji‚Äôs or a simple generic message like ‚Äúnice pic.‚Äù

  

On the flip, Comments that have 4 or more words generate real engagement. These comments actually have a noticeable effect on your Instagram algorithm.

  

Finally we took a look at the Story feature. There was a massive growth if user created stories and watched other users stories. Creating stories that actually generate engagement effect your Instagram algorithm as a whole.

  

The simple breakdown of metrics to measure by least to greatest weight are:

  

-   Likes on a photo/video
-   1 -3 word comments on a photo/video
-   4+ word comments on a photo/video
-   Saves per photo/video
-   Story views
-   Story watches
    

  

What we can deduce is that organic engagement is easy for Instagram to measure. Trying to game the system by spamming tons of likes on a photo through engagement groups is finished.

  

Trying to build a ‚Äúsave only‚Äù engagement group won‚Äôt work either as it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to identify and adapt to one. Instagram's algorithm is much smarter than you and I.

The focus must be on generating real, quality content that resonates with the audience.

  

What this means is a real investment must put into your social media content marketing. No more ‚Äúpass it to the intern to handle‚Äù instead, actually spend money on hiring in professionals.

  

**Instagram Algorithm Comments:**

  

Diving a bit further into comments, Instagram can determine ‚Äúspam‚Äù comments. Instagram does this in two main ways.

  

The first is the quality of the comment itself. As we stated before the 3 word and under comments are generally ruled as not important and spam. This isn‚Äôt always a hard and fast rule, but as a general rule it holds true.

  

If you are having a conversation back and forth with a user, 3 words and under can be fine. As the sheer quantity of the comments works in your favor.

  

When you are leaving comments write real, authentic comments. People will come back and engage with you on your page, leaving real authentic comments.

  

The other way Instagram determines the quality of the comments is the authority of the commenter. Think of comments like you would ‚Äúbacklinks‚Äù to a website. A comment with low follower count, low quality content, and low engagement is bad for you. The quality of the comment is going to be very low in the algorithm. Compare that to a comment from an influencer or brand. That comment has more value in the algorithm

  

Instagram ranks yours account as a whole. Determining if you are a spam account that should be shadow band or promoted.

  

**The FEED is Important!**

  

Look at any big native Instagrammer whos primary revenue comes from Instagram. You will notice a consistent look and feel across every photo and the entire Instagram feed as a whole. This was a simple way of establishing your look and help with your visual branding.

  

Your feed matters more than you think! Instagrammers who had tighter, more defined feeds also generated more engagement. We determine this to be akin to a ‚Äútime on site‚Äù metric.

  

The more time a user spends on your account, the more value you are to Instagram. You are increasing their advertising revenue.

  

This also works in your favor. As users ""spam"" your account with likes and comments. Your old content gets an extra boost in the algorithm and kicks the content into someone else's feed. This gives you a nice little boost of impressions.

  

Master the feed to master the Instagram game. Find a unique style that wows fans and is native to the niche.

  

**My Assumption About the Instagram Algorithm**

  

Since I do not work for Instagram or Facebook, my findings and assumptions are not 100% verified. That said, with a little deductive reasoning, you will agree with my assumptions. We know that Facebook owns Instagram. We also know that Facebook‚Äôs business model of using data to sell advertising. See: Cambridge Analytica.

  

My assumption is that Instagram‚Äôs algorithm is 95-100% the same as Facebooks.

  

With that knowledge we can treat our content creation and distribution like Facebook.

Hey guys. I am creating Instagram Pod for photographers. Here are some requirements:
	‚Ä¢	You are photographer (Travel, Adventure,Lifestyle and Portrait)
	‚Ä¢	You are active and can comment and like posts every day
	‚Ä¢	You will be active in the pod for a long period of time
What is Instagram pod?
Instagram Pod is a group of people dedicated to liking and commenting on each others‚Äô photos, in hopes of creating engagement and ranking favorably within the algorithm. Pods are intended to help each other gain more visibility in the Instagram algorithm because if a recently posted photo is getting lots of engagement (likes, and comments with more than four words, and not a series of emojis), chances are it‚Äôll rank favorably in the algorithm.
Rules for our pod:
	‚Ä¢	When you post a picture, send it as DM to our group chat in instagram.
	‚Ä¢	Everybody as soon as they can need to go to this photo, like it and necessarily comment it with 4 or more (!) words (comments matter most for instagram algorithms)
	‚Ä¢	If possible, try to reply back to comments from pod members further adding to your comment count.
	‚Ä¢	If you miss someones post, be sure to comment it as soon as possible.
	‚Ä¢	Be gentle and work as a team.
	‚Ä¢	It is very important to follow these rules, especially about commenting with 4 or more words. 
If you are interested, please send me a message with link to your Instagram profile. Let's help each other to grow!",,IGPods,"""instagram algorithm""",1527613094,Instagram Pod for photographers,2018-05-29 16:58:14,sensemaking,,

16,"Ok guys this is getting a bit weird and I think we should fix the situation here.

There has been a huge increase of posts with people complaining about the algorithm, or not getting new followers, or not getting top hashtags. You know what type I mean. Those ""I am doing everything properly and I still can't grow"" type of posts.

And then you visit their IG and the engagement is like 3%. 200 likes per 10K accounts. Only and exclusively bot comments. 

There is absolutely no excuse to having less than 10% engagement if you have less than 100K, your followers are real, and you work on your community. No excuse at all. For those under 10K it should be even more than 10%.

So I thought we should share some advices here. Because honestly, I want to help, but commenting on more posts only to find out they're doing the same, basic, mistakes, makes me a bit unimpressed. 

So, the business.

Don't put those basic captions with only one word/ emojis/ hashtags. Selena Gomez can do that shit, because she is a celebrity and people care about her no matter how basic she can be. You are a normal ass person, a stranger. You don't have fans. Stop that.

Same goes for basic quotes in captions. Now, I used to do this too, and trust me that it is bad. It's not bringing out your personality properly, it's not connecting you to your audience, and you just come off as preachy and unmotivated. Don't do it. Song lyrics are the same thing.

Your captions should be personal and encouraging commenting. Ask people something, or share your personal story, or a process of creating something. Bring out your personality. You're selling that too, and it's maybe more important than your content in the long run. Make people go ""Hey, this acc posted, I really like their humour/sarcasm/random facts sharing/art style explaining captions, so I can't wait to read it and share my insight"" type of feel. They likely aren't so enthusiastic, but I hope you get my point.

Btw those ""comment your fav color letter by letter"" are weird and not really a proper engagement. I don't even know if IG algorithm takes those into consideration, maybe someone else has a better insight about that. The primary problem is that they are basic and overused by meme accounts. The ""taking content from 9gag"" type meme accounts. 

Always, A L W A Y S, reply to your comments. Especially in the first hour after posting, and especially if they took the time to actually write a proper comment. Always reply. If you ignore them, they will probably react negatively and refuse to comment in the future. Also always try to reply genuinely, if they mention something ask them about it, it's basic human interaction. They are people. Not your fans and hopefully not bots. People who want to interact with you, so give it to them.

You must have a great engagement with your mutuals, so people who follow you and you are following them in return. There is no excuse to having less likes than the number of people you're following, unless you started your account, like, yesterday, or you're following 500 celebrities. Always do likes on your feed, leave comments as often as possible, and make sure to follow people in your community to create bonds with them. 

If your feed is full of people you don't care about, who have content not related to yours in any way and are not engaged on your account, congrats, you are doing the follow-unfollow method. Stop it. 

OK I have no inspiration atm. I sorta hope to gather good engagement accounts here to leave more advices, or if your engagement is shit leave your link so we could tell you what you're doing wrong? I don't really know where I was going with this, I just want to help somehow.","problem, sensemaking",Instagram,"""ig algorithm""",1526725033,Advice/rant post for engagement,2018-05-19 10:17:13,"problem, sensemaking",sensemaking ,
90,"Hey - Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today I interviewed Susie Shaughnessy who started her own premium denim jeans brand.

- Learned the denim craft working at Levis.
- Gained experience starting a small jewelry line with her sisters
- Friends helped her model the jeans and do a photoshoot
- Working to beat the Instagram algorithm

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hey ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm Susie Shaughnessy, owner and designer of [Crawford Denim and Vintage Co](https://crawford-denim.com/). The small-batch denim brand is a mix of New + Vintage apparel for Men + Women, rooted in classic Americana style. The new designs are influenced by the vintage collection but made to fit modern silhouettes. Each piece is crafted in California from deadstock or USA made goods. 

I‚Äôve been teaming up with some great friends to collaborate on designs in order to increase the reach of the brand. Selling the vintage collection monthly at Long Beach Flea Market has also helped introduce Crawford Denim to a much larger audience. These steps have incrementally increased traffic to the site and sales. 

### What's ****your**** backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area as the middle child in a large family. Our Dad was a long time high school football coach and our Mom managed the teams while raising the family. 

Every student was welcome in our home, making our house a constant hub of activity, sports and art. We learned early in life how rewarding working in service to others is and how to work well as a team. One person‚Äôs success is a reflection of the team‚Äôs hard work.

&gt; Having an alternate source of income will help minimize any lows in sales. It‚Äôs the insurance of making rent that allows you to focus on the brand or business that you are trying to grow.

I started my design career at Levi‚Äôs, working at some of the last US factories and learned from the true craftsmen how to build the iconic jeans. After years of designing for other American denim brands manufacturing overseas, I wanted to return to producing in the states. I did not want to lose the artform that had generated in California. Working with other small businesses + craftsmen, we can each benefit and help sustain our local economy.

I was looking at the [Slow Food Movement](https://www.slowfoodusa.org/) at the time of shaping my plan for Crawford Denim. Their movement to eat local foods in support of small, sustainable farms to reduce waste and eliminate pesticides were practices I wanted to employ in the apparel industry. Working locally reduces the need for gas for overseas shipping and using deadstock + vintage fabrics keeps them from landfills. These fabrics not only have great character, but were often created from cotton grown without pesticides or GMOs. 

While the head Designer at Old Navy, I started a small jewelry + crafts line with my sisters. It was a good introduction on how to set up an online business and sell in person. I was able to work on my skills without a huge investment for product inventory and develop best practices knowing eventually I would launch Crawford Denim. 

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

After designing several denim blocks, testing both deadstock and USA made denim; I made 1st samples with a small, local manufacturer who had been referred by my patternmaker. They are unique in that they sew nearly every type of product, sample in house and have low minimums. 

Having developed a good relationship with them over the years have allowed us to grow together. They still remain devoted to small businesses; keeping their costs reasonable, while still paying fair, livable wages. Using deadstock fabrics utilizes great vintage cottons and rayons that had been shelved, and keeps them out of landfills. 

The Men‚Äôs product did well immediately. The raw denim for the Straight Selvage and Skinny Jeans are still the most popular styles. There were some production issues with sizing for the Women‚Äôs denim, so we tried to solve the problems. After a couple of years of getting to know our female customer better - I‚Äôve changed the denim silhouettes all together. Using a different fit model, we‚Äôve modified the shape of the jeans and created more unique denim styles, evolving beyond the basic five pocket. 

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Creating the visual story for the brand was the biggest goal. Without a big budget, I asked friends to model and photograph for me. We went to the Crawford family ranch with motorcycles + ripped around the area, capturing what was meaningful to me: friends, family, quality goods and the quintessential California lifestyle. 

Working in trade also allowed my friends to be able to wear the jeans + tops and give me feedback on the fit and fabrics. I was able to make some adjustments before adding the styles online. I created the site through Shopify which is an easy platform that‚Äôs highly customizable with secure payment options. Mostly friends were the 1st to purchase online as a show of support. I was fortunate to partner with [Seaweed + Gravel](https://seaweedandgravel.com/), a motorcycle and apparel store in Leucadia, CA. My customer base grew immediately as they are able to try on the product in person. Because of that experience, I offer free return + exchange shipping so buying online is a little easier.  

I put a lot of thought into the packaging of the product. Receiving a well packaged + thoughtful piece changes a consumer‚Äôs opinion immediately for a brand. The styles come in logo‚Äôd muslin bags with postcard from the lookbook along with the order receipt, tied together with denim selvage tape. Whether it is a gift for someone or for yourself, each of the boxes I ship are packaged like a present. 

I spent a year developing the styles and working on ensuring all permits were filed properly. I couldn‚Äôt afford a lawyer or accountant to file all the necessary forms, so I taught myself how to. Now I‚Äôm able to assist other small businesses on how to set up their companies in California. 

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Before the algorithm of Instagram changed, I was making a sale with nearly every 100 new followers. Now, it is much harder to attract new followers, stay in the feeds of followers and convert to sales. 

Instagram has a few key tools that are useful to businesses. Connecting the account with Facebook allowed me to track the analytics of my followers: when they are scrolling, what types of photos or products resonate with them, even to what days and times of the week are best for maximum penetration of a post. I try to track this information weekly so to better present the brand to my current followers and attract more.  

Fortunately, I‚Äôve been able to continue to team with events, friends + shops who help promote the brand. I now work with a group of female makers + designers to try to beat the algorithm. I wanted to focus on developing my female audience and have them understand my products + the value investing in a quality denim jean. 

The pod group has worked in helping to grow the female demographic without depleting the male consumer. We each like + comment on one another‚Äôs posts within the hour that they are live. This helps override the algorithm + moves your post higher in the queue of the current followers. With more likes, Instagram will even push it to more non-followers as a recommended brand to follow. I will be launching the new women‚Äôs denim styles shortly, so I hope to increase the conversion of buyers utilizing this pod group + a friend who is an Instagram influencer. 

Promoting the brand through social media is a new method for leveling the playing field with much larger brands. Most followers are attracted to the idea of discovering a company, having insider knowledge and peaks behind the scenes. I have been resistant to share much of this information, because I want folks to be attracted to the product rather than a personality. But I am learning that by utilizing the Stories Feature on Instagram, I can share more about the inner workings and small batch craft that goes into the designs without the longevity of a post. The story is just a quick snapshot to entice followers without overwhelming the consumer. 

Participating in shows, pop ups and fleas has really grown the audience; building the number of consumer‚Äôs eyes on the product. Because denim generally sells more in the fall and winter, I try to keep folks involved in the brand with new shirts, tees and vintage during the spring and summer months. 

Two major shows I participate in are [Desert + Denim](https://www.desertanddenim.com/) in Joshua Tree, CA and the [Tennessee Motorcycle and Music Revival](http://motorcyclesandmusic.com/), hosted by the Loretta Lynn Family in Hurricane Mills, TN. These two events promote small, USA made vendors and makers. Having built the jeans with motorcycle riders in mind, allows them to try on the jeans and hop on their bike at the shows; illustrating how the gap at the waistband is minimized and the knees are comfortable even bent over long periods of riding.

Becoming a regular vendor at Long Beach Flea Market has also increased the number of local folks being introduced to the brand. The Crawford Denim and Vintage Co. booth is curated to the trends of the month, like a mini store - complete with a dressing room. 

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

I scaled back last year, trying to manage the changes in the country with fewer people buying high end product at small, local boutiques. 

Some of those businesses are no longer in operation or have moved away from USA made product. A percentage of those store‚Äôs customers continue to shop my product online. I only make the styles I can afford to. The goal is to keep incrementally growing the customer base and maintain steady, positive sales online + in select shops with more unique and limited edition product. 

After years of perfecting the fit of the jeans, I‚Äôd like to introduce the brand to more established boutiques with great online businesses in addition to their brick and mortars. Working with fewer but more strategic locations will help establish the brand name and product. 

I continue to sew the women‚Äôs smallest batches of styles and the customized product, which takes a lot of time. I gratefully have an intern to help during the busiest of times. Over the long term, I‚Äôd like to employ another full time person to help with all aspects of the business; design and sewing, customer service + fulfillment, photo shoots and website maintenance. Currently my sister Maggie steps into help, who‚Äôs assistance is invaluable! 

Since I also work with and consult for other small brands, my time is very limited. I am still trying to balance each work obligation + my personal time, maintaining a healthy lifestyle while meeting deadlines. My goal in having another employee that can share my role will enable us both to accomplish it all.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful  advantageous?

Kindness gets you far. Being a brand that works to partner + help other businesses really helps to showcase each one of us all together. We can have our own individual voice within a community, unifying us as makers. We have all pitched in to help one another. One brand or boutique‚Äôs success is a reflection of all of our efforts. 

&gt; Anything that could go wrong, did.

I worked with a larger company within the first year of business, that wanted to promote small California makers. I was nervous about overextending my budget and over taxing my small audience in the hopes of growing my business. Anything that could go wrong, did. 

Even though my product was well received, I did not have control over how the larger company displayed it online. The company‚Äôs marketing team decided that they didn‚Äôt like the project and very purposefully minimized it online. Trying to deal with multiple divisions within their organization as a one-woman brand was unevenly pitted and unrealistic. 

I luckily took some precautions within my contract to avoid major financial losses, but I am still trying to recover from those losses. It was a great lesson to listen to my instincts. It was also good to know not to overextend my customer‚Äôs or my own bandwidth. Just because they were willing to buy one piece, does not ensure they will buy all of your product month after month.   

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

I use Shopify for the website, Square for selling in person and Paypal + Venmo to invoice personal sales. 

I rely mostly on USPS ‚Ä¶ and have become great friends with my local post office. Shipping online through USPS is super easy and less expensive than any other carrier. 

I am just starting to use MailChimp to reach a broad audience of newsletter readers. I try to send out a monthly message, so not to bombard customers but also let them know where we are going to be popping up. 

Tumblr is a great vehicle in addition to Instagram for my showcasing the brand‚Äôs product through photography and inspirational images. I can tell a full story of what‚Äôs developing behind the scenes and influencing my designs. My Tumblr feed has been named one of the top denim trend blogs. 

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources for your business and why?**

I listen religiously to [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this). I am a big fan of the Ted Radio Hour, but How I Built This directly relates to all of the ups and downs of being a business owner. It‚Äôs a great reminder that being a small business owner takes a lot of time and endurance for all the ups and downs. Being hard working and ready for everything really is the everlasting message in each of their stories. Luck is what you make of it. 

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Having an alternate source of income will help minimize any lows in sales. It‚Äôs the insurance of making rent that allows you to focus on the brand or business that you are trying to grow. It‚Äôs not easy, but every entrepreneur has had some source of steady income that can get them through the tough months. 

I built the brand around the brand, not around myself. It helps eliminate the personal emotions that can get tied to product ‚Ä¶ meaning that if folks don‚Äôt all love a photo on Instagram, it‚Äôs the style or the photo, not how *you* look in the product. 

I hardly ever show my own photo on Instagram or Tumblr. I focus instead on the product + showcase the folks and friends who embody the California lifestyle of the brand.

18,"I have a foot fetish account on IG. Got back into it after being a lurker for a few months. 

I noticed using certain hashtags worked on some photos and not others. I tried up upload a photo from a old DSLR and it didn't work. I also tried to upload a photo set a friend sent me through text. Not DSLR but she may have an iPhone where I have Android. Not sure but the pics are high quality. All the pics from her set don't work either. Just her feet in the tub, no nudity. 

I'd copy and paste the same tags on another random feet pics and its fine, the pic shows in the tag feed. After 10 tries with one pic it finally worked after adding a filter, using the same copy and pasted tags that wouldn't worked the previous ten tries with the same photo. 

Trying to simply add a filter to another pic from the same set with the same tags fails. I haven't been able to get another one working since. 

This is the 4th day messing with this.

Eventually I tried using random hashtags with the pics. Like #hiphop or #butteredbread. Nothing.


Then I noticed if I use my own hashtags, like #makingmyownhashtagstotestthisshadowbanbull, it doesn't work either, but instead of just showing no results it shows the ""this post was hidden due to community guidelines blah blah"". How was the photo reported when I just posted it? How is that tag banned? 

I tried something like #ignamesbtest to make it simpler. Same thing. But if I add that tag to a photo that's already working then it will show two results in the ""hidden"" results and the working one will show. 

I'll go grab another random photo from my collection and it works. 

Something is def scanning the photos from metadata or something. I even used quickpic and collage to flip and re-save the images and still won't work. 

If I try to screenshot the photo from my gallery and upload that it doesn't work either. I doubt a screenshot can carry over metadata, so how would a screenshot be consistent with the error? 

The only other thing is the pics are sorta similiar between the friend sent ones and the DSLR one is there are all close up shots of bare feet that take up most of the shot. Any other pics that worked with tags are ones that had more in the background or more going on in the pic. 

Is there a new IG algorithm that thinks my upclose feet photos are nudity somehow? Could ig always bot-scan uploads? I doubt a human is seeing and blocking my uploads in the milliseconds.

I know there is no solution to the shadow ban or an accurate description of what causes it.

But I feel like I should share this info this there isn't much online about it when the comes to the issues of possible file types or other file specific issues that are beyond the same old ""don't overuse hashtags, don't use third party apps bullshit""",problem,Instagram,"""ig algorithm""",1525582119,Shadow ban or bug on certain photo file types?

What is Instagram pod?

Instagram Pod is a group of people dedicated to liking and commenting on each others‚Äô photos, in hopes of creating engagement and ranking favorably within the 
algorithm. Pods are intended to help each other gain more visibility in the Instagram algorithm because if a recently posted photo is getting lots of engagement (likes, and comments with more than four words, and not a series of emojis), chances are it‚Äôll rank favorably in the algorithm.

*When you post a picture, send it as DM to our group chat in Instagram.

*When someone posts in the group, everyone needs to like the post and leave a thoughtful comment larger than 5 words. This is not a copy paste unconscious pod. The goal is to have 10-15 people who actually like photography and are going to commit to engaging with posts from this circle.

I have a feeling that Instagram will be doing a little spring cleaning of their own and cleaning up many of the spam accounts. It's important that you post content that serves their community this is even stated in their terms of use.Follow my 90/10 rule which is to post all value 90% of the time and only push people to your offer in your bio 10% of the time.

**Post More**
This is important until the algorithm changes take effect because you‚Äôre people are active at different times and you want to make sure you are staying in front of them. I recommend posting a minimum of 5 times per day and no more than 10 til the changes take effect.

**Use Relevant Hashtags**
To help boost your posts on Instagram use relevant hashtags so they are easier to find on Instagram.

**Know When To Post**
Use tools like Square Lovin‚Äô to track your Instagram analytics. It‚Äôs important that you know the best times to post to get the most out of your content. I like to use Hootsuite to schedule all my social media content including Instagram. It helps keep me consistently posting at the right time and it‚Äôs also great for repurposing some of your older content and sharing other accounts posts.

There is also a lot of talk about Vero, a new platform that is supposedly better. Allowing higher resolution pictures, no ads and a much less intrusive feed algorithm. Some have expressed concerns with Vero's policies such as them being able to use your content free of royalties and a future subscription fee.

**Intro**

Having first-hand experience developing similar ""discovery"" algorithms it pains me that so many people being deceived about what the ""Instagram Algorithm"" actually is.


Any so called social media consultant that advises you, based on their ""knowledge"" of a so called algorithm, is just doing a part of their job: telling you some mumbo-jumbo or words they likely even don't have enough knowledge to understand so they appear more credible or their services more appealing. When in fact the things they do that actually get you true/real followers and true/real likes are just tried and true marketing strategies applied to a new medium. What these John Snow's don't tell you is that they know nothing about how an actual computer algorithm works. But let me just say that I respect the work that actual marketeers do, with real marketing strategies and actual studies - these are the ones you should trust.

---
**TL;DR: Research your audience not an algorithm.**
---

[What the algorithm actually is: An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task - which in this particular case is to deliver/provide a client (App or Website) with structured content (JSON - for the sake of simplicity - but there are other ways too). This content is an ordered object list of meta-information that composes an instagram post (title, author, photo url, etc). What we do know about the delivery of the posts contained in this list/array is that it is dependent on who is asking for it (client), at what time was the request made, the location from which the request is was made from. All else is more open to debate as it really depends on the engagement of said posts (total number of likes, total number of comments within a given time) this criteria contrary to popular belief has many permutation throughout the year, I'd even say, based on experience that it most likely has numerous permutations every single day! Instagram is also likely using a ""computer generated persona"" (based on their engagement) of each user to figure out the best posts to display and the order in which to display them. Specific details will never (willingly) be made public.](/s)

---

So let's break it down in two main categories and focus on what really matters and why:

1. Content Quality
2. Engagement

---

1 - Content Quality
As you've probably heard before ""content is king"", if you put out shit posts, bad quality photos you'll never get the following/reach you are after.
This will be the hardest. You are targeting humans and it's impossible to please everyone no matter how hard you try (duh). It's vital to research your audience.


**What you can do:**

* Focus on a specific niche (the broader the scope the harder it gets to please everyone - marketing basic stuff);
* Have a theme (or don't) if you think your audience cares for it;
* Improve your composition and editing;
* Look at each and every one of your posts and find out if ""in a vacuum"" they are good enough (it may be the first post of yours a user encounters - make it a good one);
* Look for hashtags related to the content you want to put out and check what are the best performing posts and try to figure out why.

---

2 - Engagement

If you've read this far you probably know that trying to ""play an algorithm"" is an option off the table, if you see someone growing (organically) really fast on instagram is because they're putting out great content and engaging their audiences using actual marketing tactics.

**What can you do:**

* Post consistently - you want your target audience to be exposed to your content as often as possible (number of posts per day varies from niche to niche and common sense also works - too few and people will forget you, too much and people will report you as spam);
* Pick the right time to post - post when your audience is more engaged (again this will depend on your audience);
* Employ real human-targeting marketing tactics - comment (with genuine thoughts), like, subscribe, put out ads, cross-post in other platforms, collaborate with other instagram accounts...
* Hashtags - IG has a limit of 30 per post, use them, use them wisely as they help your posts be more discoverable (people who search specific hashtags will find your posts (duh) and also your are more likely to appear on the discovery page of a user if he tends to like posts with similar tags - to what extent, again, Instagram will never tell us - related to each users ""persona"").

179,"I have experienced 4 shadowbans and I own several pages some 10-500K followers, I will tell you guys what causes a shadowban and how to fix it, how long it stays etc. 

What a shadowban is: Your posts will not appear in the explore page and your hashtags will not work, only your own followers can see your posts or users that search up your page manually. 

How long it stays: 
From my experience as well as others your shadowban will stay for 14 days, If your post has been removed along with the shadowban, if you were caught using a bot it may take longer. But usually it stays for 14 days. 

How to avoid it: 
Do not use broken hashtags etc banned ones, do not post violent posts they will get removed or if your posts get reported a lot they will get removed and you can get banned; but the new update is if you go against instagram algorithm you get banned so if you suddenly post a lot they think you are spamming so you get banned, do not use 3rd party apps that post for you or access your account, and do not post unusually, they will think you are a bot. For instance you need at least 6 hours of no posts a day so they know you are a human and you aint posting during sleep. 

How to remove it: 
You literally cannot remove it at all, you just have to wait for the 2 weeks, theres no other way. Id recommend just posting images and not videos as your videos will get really really less views and you dont want your followers to see that.

How the algorithm works is simple and can be used to your benefit when growing your Instagram page. When you like a post that post it shows up in your followers explore page. This is because the algorithm recommends posts according to the accounts users follow.

1,"Hey there. I run a social media marketing agency, but I've specialized in Instagram management for the past 2-3 years. 


One thing I've noticed is the rising demand for automating your Instagram account. This is done by purchasing a bot, such as Massplanner or Followliker, and automating your Instagram account to follow, unfollow, like, comment and DM people automatically. Many people also choose to do this manually which is also a no no.


No offence to all the businesses who sell Instagram automation services, but the reason this method of growing your account is so full of sh*t is because you are forcing people to follow you, out of their will. 


For example, your account is in the cars niche and you decide to follow a bunch of people who liked a recent post by a huge cars account. Chances are pretty high that people who are already interested in car pages will follow your page as well. But guess what? Are they more willing to interact with an extremely large car page or yours?


There's a 90% chance that they are only following you back out of respect, courtesy, or the fact that not many pages send them a follow request so it's a ""big thing"" for them. You are forcing them to make a decision to follow you by engaging them first.


Out of my years of experience in the Instagram game, these followers are the least engaging, unless you post out-of-the-world unique content which catches their eye. But even then, there will be a large account already posting such content and you will most likely be overshadowed. 


**Botting your way to Instagram growth is SLIGHTLY better than just going ahead and buying fake followers.** Period! The only difference is that fake followers never like your posts and there is no activity, where as the botted/forced followers may like your post once in a blue moon. 


**What 99% of people fail to realize is that Instagram isn't about the having the highest number of followers, it's about having the highest engagement!** A 100k page which has 0 activity will grow extremely slow and not grab as much attention as a booming 5000-follower page with 2,000 likes and 25 comments per post.


By the way, I forgot to mention this: Posting the same 20-30 hashtags repeatedly in every single post gets you shadowbanned. **Hashtags are absolutely worthless (unless you are geotagging) when it comes to growing your account and I could write a whole other post regarding them.** 

Let's say your automated account does get engagement and you have a post which gets a lot of likes and comments. Are the comments saying ""Amazing content!"" ""Lovely post!"" ""Love your posts, would love to get in touch with you!"" ""You have great content"" Basically a general comment and nothing specific to your post? Well guess what, those guys are running automation just as you are! They are commenting on posts which have specific hashtags and are commenting on posts just like yours so other people see them. **The real, natural users of Instagram, aka potential consumers, can sense Instagram automation a mile away!** 


I am not saying that botting your account will get you 0 sales or 0 good followers. **But I am definitely saying 99% of your followers are worthless.** 

The only time I recommend you follow people to try and getting them follow you back, is if you are a brand new account with 0 followers. You can do this to gain about 3 to 4 thousand followers at best so you have something to start out on. However, even then it's not needed if you can get in to a network of influencers and engagement groups or you understand how viral marketing on Instagram works. 


Trust me guys, I have used automation for several clients the past few years and I've gotten them to 10,000, not-so-engaging followers within 2-3 months. 


I now only market and manage Instagram accounts via engagement groups, network influencing and adapting to Instagram's algorithms. This has helped me land a few clients on the 'Explore' page of Instagram, helped their content go viral, and attract much, much more followers naturally.

I tried to give ads a try, also trash. Turns out people don't like ads when they are browsing for fun or inspiration 

The only thing that has slowed the unfollowing is not posting which had the opposite effect before the change . Also the only way to get engagement for me now is posting at 2am to get shown by 12pm that same day.

I know, new instagram algorithm and so on, but then why i see people with 2k followers getting 300 likes per pic? And i'm not talking about different pics, but SAME pics (not similar, but SAME, i'm a photographer and my pic go both on my feed and model feed).
For a period, i tried to sign as business so i could access INSIGHTS and see what's happening.
Well, after 1 day of posting, my pic was SHOWED ON 5% of my total followers (around 1000). It means that i don't get likes anymore not because people doesn't like my pictures, but because they ARE NOT EVEN GETTING showed to my followers.
I'm not shadow-banned cause i can see my pictures on my hashtags, but even if that was, i don't ask to be SEEN by external people, but just my followers! Is it possible that Instagram is performing a kind of ""level-up"", by showing more people with less followers instead of people with a big audience? Why 20k people that are following me can't see my post on their wall? This is really getting annoying cause i'm doing everything right but i feel like someone put a weight on my ankles. Any clue?

21,"      Over the past few days, I have noticed that Instagram has significantly changed their algorithms. After Facebook buying the application and contributing advertisements readily available for consumers, influencers who already have a high follower content or have money to pay for advertisements are being given the traffic. Instagram has blown up these past few months with articles on Forbes, Buzzfeed, and BBC's platforms. Social media marketing is extremely mainstream now. 
	So, it makes sense that if you pay money, you should get traffic but this change on Instagram, as well as on YouTube, supports the idea that popular social media applications are not supporting the lower-tier consumers. Developing traffic to your Instagram used to be simpler. You could attach a few tags and still receive a fair amount of traffic for your content. The platform was supporting those who had a smaller follower count and was a community to bring up everyone.
	Although, recently, I've noticed with one of my accounts that the only traffic I was now generating was only from my own followers, even with using the tags that I previously used. I attempted to update myself. Doubting the time frame of when I was posting, changing up the tags, providing even better content, I thought I could change the outcome, but nothing changed. Therefore, yes, there is definitely an algorithm change and this (for lack of a better term) sucks for lower-income artists and entrepreneurs who want to provide quality content for the world to see on a platform they initially thought would help them but is now supporting only those that have money.
	For example, one of my instagram account's with about 260 followers used to easily reach 100 likes. A majority came from my tags and the rest came from my follower count. I now post pictures and only receive two likes. One like from my brother who has my post notifications on and the other usually from someone who randomly was lucky enough to see my post at the right time. 
	After trying to research on the internet ‚Äúinstagram algorithm‚Äù change, I came to realize that nobody was talking about it! Which made me even more annoyed. So while having a conversation of being frustrated after posting another picture with my brother, I decided to write about the situation. 
	On another note, if you haven't noticed already, but the pictures on your current news feeds aren't in a timely order. Your news feed now begins with usually the most popular picture in your following, or the one that received an increase of likes in a shorter time period. You can have posts show up from 3 days ago or 16 hours ago. It's all out of order. 
	I understand the importance of generating an income from advertisements but what about all of the people that wanted to outlet their passions to the world? Popular social media platforms are just becoming digital tabloids. As much as I used to love Instagram, it's becoming another Facebook, which is inevitable since Facebook bought them, but I think it's time to move on to another platform that actually practices what they preach. 
	Therefore, if any of you have any recommendations, want to share how you feel on this, provide extra information, feel free to do so!

23,"Hi guys
I am a professional Fitness and Boudoir Photographer.  My IG is www.instagram.com/Resilience.Pictures if you're interested in it.

.

I started an Instagram POD on Telegram messenger for Fitness or boudoir photography, Fitness, Health,  Food.  We only have 3 members right now, but plan on growing to 50 one day.  We are looking for only active  users on a daily basis, so I only want active Users.   Please DM me if you're interested.

.

Why on Telegram?  Telegram allows for more than 15  users in the group.  It is also a safer way to engage.  Instagram has been known for  paying attention to PODS hosted on IG and banning those who uses it.  Most importantly, we're a small tight group right now so it helps to prevent leechers by removing them and replacing them with valuable users.

.

If interested, leave your Telegram and IG user name below or DM them to me.

.

RULES:
1.When making new posts, please drop your IG link post here. 

2.How to share link from mobile.  Open your post and click on ""..."" icon on the top right, 
  then Copy Share URL. Paste it to the group.

3.All users must like and comment on all new posts within 24 hours regardless of posting or not.

4.All comments must be at least 4 words and relate to the post.  No spammy emotes.

5.2 posts maximum per day up for Like and Commenting.

6.Everyone must indicate that they've liked and commented by using ""Heart Emoji"".

7.To make this work, please be active and highly engaged regardless if you post or not.  Inactivity will get you removed from the group so we can make
  space for people who are willing to help.

8.Lets not forget that this group is to help us all fight the Instagram Algorithm so we can all get noticed.

9.If you want to use multiple accounts, then you must comment and like from each additional account.

10.Most important. Please do not leech!

11. Please only post your link after you've completed liking and commenting all user's posts.  

12. We're a small group, so every ""Like"" and ""comment"" is valuable to us.

5,"Hi everyone, I recently took up a client work on social media management (more of a friend,  for low end profit) to expand my portfolio from just creating landing pages (for leads) and PPC management.

The current setup is 4posts/week across FB + IG with different content, and i have set up brand new FB + IG profiles for his business.

Here's what i did so far:

1) Researching on his competitors, top content creators to identify what type of content works with high engagements.

2) Audience profiling to understand what his demographics like and to create/curate content in similar direction. This means not advertising on his service but focused on content that brings engagement.

3) Identifying a variety of hashtags (20-30 per post) for IG and rotating them to prevent IG algorithm from reducing our organic reach due to repeated hashtags.

4) Started out with Hootsuite for scheduling and to monitor on trending hashtags in hopes to like/follow/comment and gain followers from there.

So i started it for about a week and realized that so far it has not been as effective as i hoped, particularly for Facebook. As my client does not want to invest in PPC or post boosting, it's really hard so far to get organic likes on FB posts (And i don't use hashtags for FB posts as well)

Does anyone have any actionable steps i can take to gain more organic likes/followers? Also, is 4post/week too little for totally brand new social media pages (bear in mind its a new business as well - upcoming brick and motar cafe)

* Ask users to DM you (both from a post or story)
* Ask user to visit your profile (perhaps they have to visit your profile to answer a question and win a prize)
* Tag yourself in your post to encourage visits to your profile (As above)
* Ask users to search for you in the explore section (hard to imagine how you could ask this)


I don't know if any of these would work or how effective they would be, just having a stab in the dark. These are ways i think that tell Instagram that this person is interested in your content and thus they will see it higher in their feeds.

Maybe you're working fulltime but are living paycheck to paycheck because you have a debt to repay. Maybe you're doing fine and just want to make some extra cash to invest into your main business. Or maybe you just want something productive to do with your free time.

Last year I made a few bad business moves and had to halt work temporarily due to some mental health issues. By the time I was back on track and had things rolling again, I had no money in the bank. I wasn't in trouble, but needed more money to make more money, and I hustled and made as much money as I could. Here are 3 things that I did to make some money when I really needed it:

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------


**1. Importing Tech &amp; Reselling Locally**

Buy from Aliexpress and list on classified ads websites (I'm talking Craigslist, Gumtree, Kijiji, etc.). Buy low, sell high. It's as easy as drop shipping, and you can start with any amount of money. Say you have $200 to work with: you could buy a 20x $10 smartwatches (I did well selling the U80 watch, just make sure it comes in a sealed retail box and has a strong and comfortable band, also check reviews, there are lots of variations of the same products going around in China), list them for $15-$20 each and offer free local delivery (if you have a vehicle you can drive around in), and publish your ad to local classified ads websites or Facebook groups. I'd recommend getting a $19 'Square' card reader so that you can take card payments as well, people appreciate the professionalism and the fact they don't need to get cash out in advance.

It might take you a month or two to sell those 20 smartwatches, but then you'll have turned your $200 into $300-$400, and you can go for round 2 with multiple products and more of them, or just bank it and put it into something else. Once you have a few thousand dollars, you'll be able to buy enough products to have constant stock with a wider variety and have a consistent stream of revenue coming in (the revenue could be anywhere from a hundred dollars, to several hundred dollars depending on how much money to have to use to buy stock, where you live, competition, time, etc.).

Products that I had success with included luxury looking smartwatches, fitness watches, car dash cams, cheap wireless security cameras, cheap drones, gaming headsets and gaming mice. You'll need to test your own local market to see what works for you.

*Tips: Buy a portable card reader so you can take card payments (Square sells one for $19 that plugs into your phone). Offer free delivery if you can, it will increase sales. If you don't have a good camera, use the photos from the Aliexpress listing, even though they are generally bad they come across as more professional than dark low quality phone photos. Don't advertise a warranty, but replace anything that is broken out of the box or doesn't last (or just refund them); it's a good business practice. Be careful with what you buy from China; if a smartwatch you sold explodes when charging, burns down the buyers house and kills someone, it's on you (if you can't afford insurance or to register the gig as a business, just be cautious with what you sell). Check local stores and the sites you are going to list your products on before ordering to make sure there isn't competition with that specific product, or at the least make sure you are the cheapest seller in your area. Spend time writing your listing copy, get it perfect before publishing. You may need to relist each item every few days as they can get pretty far down the ranks on classified ads sites and stop getting found pretty quickly. Experiment with listing upgrades (highlighting, homepage promotion, etc.).*

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------

**2. Selling Services**

The services you can offer will depend on what you have. If you have a lawn mower or other landscaping related equipment, you can start offering garden care services. If all you have is an iron, start ironing peoples clothes and charge by the basket. There are several airconditioner cleaning businesses in my local area that make a killing; they charge around $100 per aircon and the average house probably gets 3 done at a time, they seem to take 40 minutes a piece. What I personally did was lawn mowing.

Once you have your equipment and know what service you want to provide, review your competition. The good thing is, you don't need to be the cheapest and as long as it's something that has alot of demand in your area you'll be able to get customers (hopefully repeat customers).

If you're broke, get some paper and a marker, and draw up flyers (or design and print them off a computer if you have access to one). Put them on notice boards, hand them out, deliver to letterboxes; whatever you need to do. Make sure to let friends and family know what you're doing as well, they may be interested themselves or could refer someone who would be. A website isn't a must if it's a short term thing, however it can make you look more professional and established and get you higher end clients; a WordPress theme is $50, learning to customize it is free, and website hosting can be as low as $1 / month.

*Tips: Offer the best service possible. If you have the skills, time, and money then setup a website, create a logo, brand your uniform, and go all out after you've tested your local market and know that the service your offering is going to work. Don't waste money on a TV or radio ad for the service sidegig, you can advertise for free on classified ads websites and local Facebook groups. Letterbox delivery services often have good deals for first time customers; last month I saw a company offering flyer design, printing, and delivery to 10K houses for just a few hundred dollars. Don't be the cheapest as you might miss out on customers who think you're services could be dodgy, there are lots of people in my area who pay $100 to have their lawn mowed even though people offer the same service for $40; don't work twice as hard to bring in the same money as a competitor.*

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------

**3. Growing &amp; Selling Instagram &amp; Twitter Accounts**

If you're tech savvy, this can be an easy way to make some money. It's free, and requires very little work time, however takes a few months to grow each account and make any money. I sold several packages of accounts that I grew and it was really easy money.

Sign up to a service for either Instagram or Twitter that allows you to automate your account growth. The software will need to be able to follow and unfollow other users, and schedule posts, that's it.

Create say 10 accounts on Twitter, and 10 accounts on Instagram, and connect them to the website/software that automates the growth tasks. Set up the follow and unfollow feature so that the software follows and unfollows around 500 people per day, and press go.

Go to a free stock photo website such as https://pixabay.com/, search keywords relating to your accounts niches, and download 20 photos for each account. Use the software to create the posts all at once, and schedule the 20 photos so 1 is posted every 5 days to each account.

After the 3 months once all of the schedule posts have been published, each account should have close to 5000 followers (assuming your have your follow/unfollow settings setup okay so you can achieve a 10%+ followback rate).

What you'll want to do now is sign up to EpicNPC here: https://www.epicnpc.com/forums/583-Social-Media and create an ad in the social media section promoting the accounts that you are selling. If you sell 20 accounts together with 5K followers each, you should get $150-$300 USD. It's not alot, however it's very easy and even though it takes 3-4 months to get paid, it is only like 1 day of setup work so is still worth it.

*Tips: Don't set up more than 2 accounts per platform per day, otherwise your device and IP address may be flagged for spam and your current and new accounts could be banned. Accounts in travel, luxury, and fashion niches sell well right now. A source has informed me of an Instagram algorithm update that is going to be rolled out soon that will make low following accounts worthless as their post reach will be very low (because if this, I'd recommend just focusing on Twitter).*

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------

**3. Safe Sports Betting With Bonus Bets**

This is not a business, it's a one time money making idea. I was able to make a couple of hundred in 2 days with just a few hours work and a few dollars to start with, and it got me out of trouble as I did it with less than $100 in my bank account with some bills coming up.

What you need to do is turn off any ad blocker software then search google for keywords like 'sports betting', 'sports bet websites', etc. Look at the ads on the first few pages of search results, there will be a few promoting sign up bonuses (generally things like 'Deposit $10, Play With $80').

Once you have one or more websites open on the page you need to go through to get the sign up bonus, open up the terms and conditions pages to see what conditions are set on promotional money. Most websites require you to turn the money over 2-5 times before you can cash out, after that some websites take away the bonus money from the win (so if the bonus was $50 and you win $100 you're account will only show $50), and most sites require you to bet on games with certain odds (generally 1.3 or higher).

Find out the odds you need to play to quality and how many times you need to turn the money over. Then, go to the tennis section and find games that have great odds in favour of one person (I'm talking 1.2 to player 1, and 6 to player 2). Then what you need to do is not bet on the team winning, rather bet on them winning at least 1 set (which is highly likely as they are tipped to win the whole game anyways), and create a multi bet with 3-5 games involved until the odds are what they need to be.

Let's assume you deposited $10 of your own money, and the site gave you $100 to play with. To withdraw, you need to turn the money over 3 times at 1.3 odds or higher. Do the multibet strategy on Tennis matches, betting that the player will win at least 1 set. Once the game is over, if you've lost then you've lost, move onto another site that offers a good sign up bonus or just quit. If your bet won and was successful, you'd now have $130 in your account on the website.

Now remember, you need to turn the money over 2 more times before you can withdraw. Don't be stupid and gamble the money. What you need to do is find any tennis game and bet on both teams to win. Use this calculator: http://www.aussportsbetting.com/tools/online-calculators/arbitrage-calculator/ to find how how much money to place on each team, and it will work out so that you lose only a few dollars on the game no matter who wins. Make 2 bets using the same strategy, then withdraw the money and delete your account on the site.

*Tips: There is risk involved with the first bet, so don't use this method unless you can afford to lose the money. Never gamble, it's stupid and rigged, you will lose everything eventually. This works because you only need to go in with $10-$20 and can make $100+ on a very safe bet with bonus money. Do not sign up to the same website under a different name, you will get banned for claiming the bonus bet twice if you access the site and both accounts from the same IP address, device, and with the same bank account connected to deposit/withdraw to. If this method works for you, look into sports betting arbitrage; it's another way to make money with very little risk and can be used long term as opposed to just once per website.*

With the new Instagram algorithm of recent posts that show up on your feed, I notice that when I post a picture for instance on my business account, it instantly gets buried in someone else's feed (such as my personal account). 

What I mean is I can post a picture like 5 seconds ago, but on my personal account that picture is behind like 20 other pictures already (even pictures that other people posted like 2 days ago are ahead of my picture I posted 5 seconds ago!)

If this is the case for me, it must be the case for a lot of my 21k followers so it doesn't reach my follower's feed. I hope this makes sense.

Let's do a little test, I'd like to know how much followers you have on Instagram and what's the engagement rate of your last 3 posts. It would be good to see how the % compare to the total number of followers. I see plenty of big accounts that have a very low engagement rate and I'm trying to see if Instagram algorithm take into account the total number of followers...

I'll start, I'm running an account that has 20.6k followers
The last three posts had (reach/engagement/percent):

* 6365 / 1675 / 26%
* 7444 / 1627 / 21%
* 8629 / 2183 / 26.4%

So about 7% of my total followers interacted with the last post(s)

For the last week the insights were:
167k impressions
15.8k reach
3.9k profile view
115 website clicks

What's yours? I'm curious to see numbers for 50/100/200k accounts",sensemaking,socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",1483062994,Share your Instagram insights,2016-12-30 1:56:34,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking

10,"Hey guys,

First off, this isn't a ""I gained 10,000 followers in a week"" type of post. I haven't had that kind of result, but I question the quality of followers that people get in those kind of situations.

I've been playing around with Instagram for the last three days and have learned a ton in that time. I first started out on easy mode. I created an account for my weiner dog (@weinerdogbella). I had never used Instagram so I thought I'd create the account to get used to the system.

I had read an article on here about a guy who got 10,000 followers in a week using the follow, like, like, like method. If your not familiar with it you basically choose a hashtag that your target audience would use, search for it, find a post by a member of your target audience, follow him or her and like the top three most recent posts.

I tried this method and was probably getting 1 to 2 follow backs per 10 followed. I did this for a while, but started getting frustrated with the response rate. It was a lot of work and didn't get very good results.

If I remember correctly the person who got 10,000 followers in a week was doing the method on the top posts in the search feed. I ended up modifying his approach and got a 1 in 3 follow back rate. 

What I did was search the hashtag, go to the most recent posts (you can find posts within 30 seconds to 1 minute old which means its likely the user is still on Instagram so you can get a quick follow back), then I did the usual follow, like, like, like but I also commented on one post. For the dog category this was extremely easy. I would just say something ""So cute!"" or ""Beautiful dog!"". I would also use ample emoji's. I got this technique from a buffer blog article that said emoji's increase engagement. I would use emoji's like the dog with it's tongue out or the face with heart eyes. Note, Instagram will stop you from from using duplicate comments so you have to vary your comments. Another problem is that the Instagram algorithm is extremely smart. They know all the tricks. For example, I got my most recent posts feed cut off so I could only see older posts. I had to wait awhile before the newest posts came back. Instagram also limits follows per hour. This is why it's important to have a high follow back rate. This also makes me suspicious of the guy who got 10,000 followers in a week using the follow, like, like, like method. The number of users you'd have to follow would exceed the rate at which you can follow so I don't know about that, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He also used shout outs from big accounts so maybe that is how he did it.

On that topic I did get one shoutout. I followed a chihuahua account and commented on his post. I got a follow back and then a direct message asking me to do some scheme to promote his account. I responded back that I'd do a shout out for shout out. We both did, but my account only had 100 followers and his had only 300 followers at the time so I don't think it made much of a difference. It was hard to track because I was also doing the follow, like, like, like, comment technique and so all the followers I gained over that period of time where likely just people I followed.

So with the method I was using I was pulling in about 50 followers per day, so I have approximately 127 followers over two and a half days. On that note, the more followers you get the easier it is to get followers due to social proof. My follow back rate is getting pretty high. I imagine in a couple of weeks if I work at it I could have a pretty sizeable account.

So now onto hard mode. I highly recommend if you have a dog and want to get the basics down of Instagram, you start out with a dog account. It sounds silly, but its free practice. I liken it to a new video game. The first time around you play on easy mode and beat the game then you play on hard (aka business account) and beat the game again.

So here's the story of the business account. About a year ago I bought 25 bracelets off of aliexpress or alibaba (I don't remember which one) for about $1.25 a piece. I didn't do anything with them,  until recently when I listed them on Ebay. I hadn't thought of Instagram in relation to them, but before Instagram I hadn't got a single view on my listing. I've heard this is common on Ebay with new accounts. You get buried in the search results. I then thought I might try to drive traffic to the listing on Ebay through Instagram.

I created an Instagram account called Ideal Bracelets and posted some images of the bracelet last night. I also posted some other images of bracelets I found on Instagram to fill up some content. I recommend having at least 12 posts on your account before you start looking for followers. I had three of my bracelet and was getting no follow backs. I threw up some more bracelet images and then started having some mild success.

The first thing I will say about business accounts is that they are much harder to get followers than a dog account. Dogs are cute and get tons of likes and since you are not selling anything people are more likely to follow you. One thing I would do differently if I started the account again would to be more passive about my advertising. I went for a really call to action heavy approach. My sole purpose of the account is to drive traffic to my listing not to build a brand or awareness of my product so I went for heavy calls to action such as including ""buy it now"" in my bio and posts. This causes your account to come off as more of an advertisement account rather than simply showcasing your product and hoping for conversions. This approach probably mildly affected my follow back rate.

So I started with the follow, like, like, like, comment approach and wasn't getting much success. One of the biggest difficulties I've had was finding the right hashtags to find my target audience. I've tried #bracelet, #fashion, #style, #oodt, among a million others. The problem with a hashtag such as #bracelet is that the search feed is flooded with other bracelet makers. Rarely will you find an actual personal account posting #bracelet. Think about it, your a girl you dressed up cute for your Instagram picture and your wearing a bracelet, you probably don't use the hashtag #bracelet because its such a minor detail in your outfit. However, I'm looking for posts of girls wearing bracelets because that means they buy them. 

Also, hashtags like #fashion or #style are heavily used by fashion bloggers and clothing brands or big 24k female accounts with a bunch of males following. On that note, I only follow accounts with a good follower to following ratio. Ideally they follow more accounts that are following. Your chances of a follow back are directly proportional to their ratio, i.e. if they follow back generously they are more likely to follow you back. I'm still wondering if the fact that they will follow anyone makes them a less valuable customer, however, I'm just looking for conversions and if they followed you they checked out your account and possibly clicked the link to the listing so I'm happy with my approach. Also, big accounts get tons of notifications so you get buried in their feed. Also, if they are a big account I believe they are on their to get followers, not to purchase a bracelet. Its a different type of user.

So as I was saying, I had trouble finding my potential audience that was buried in all the bracelet makers and fashion blog posts. However, I did stumble onto one gold mine. There is a user called _universaltime_ who is a badass. He's selling achor bracelets that I know he got off alibaba because I've seen a ton of them on there. However he is killing it. He's got the most professional product images I've ever seen on Instagram. They are amazing. He's kicks the other bracelet makers asses. He's got a following of 106k. Here's the thing about his following though that makes him different than the other bracelet makers. I looked on the other bracelet maker accounts to poach their followers and I was sorely let down. They may have 2k followers, but the quality of followers is shit. Most are middle eastern accounts with 5 posts. There are also a lot of other designers following them which won't convert to purchases. Some of them obviously bought fake followers for social proof, but what's the point? Your engagement is shit and fake accounts don't convert. Basically I went through all of these accounts followers trying to find some to follow and they were shit.

So back to the _universaltime_ guy. I started looking through his followers because I was interested in the quality of his followers and he had a gold mine of followers. They were usually American and female and not other designers. The only crappy part was that  he had a lot of high school girls and they probably don't spend money as they don't typically have any.

I started poaching like a mad dog. I got some followers but I only followed like 20 of them. I will probably hit back up his account after writing this post to get some more. Moral of the story, find large accounts with high engagement and good quality users and start poaching. Most big accounts will have shitty followers, but if you can find an account like I did that is closely related to your product then you are good.

Another technique that I have yet to try out is you follow someone and then Instagram will recommend other accounts to follow. I assume they recommend similar users, probably based on used hashtags, similar followers and such. I haven't tried this, but it will be my next technique to try out. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't.

I've only got about 8 followers so far and I've probably spent about an hour and a half in total time so it's not bad, but its significantly slower than the dog account. I'm hoping once I get a hundred followers it will pick up. I feel something like a bracelet account needs a lot of social proof to get follow backs so it should pick up eventually and hopefully once I grow I can start selling off my bracelets.

Another trick I used was using a bit.ly link in my account so I could track the number of clicks. Out of the 8 followers I gathered I had one click which isn't bad, but I'll need a lot more clicks to get a sale. My listing still has nine days on it so I have some time.

Anyway, that's about all I have. I've learned so much about Instagram in the last three days just through trial and error. I highly recommend you start an account and just start playing around. Try different hashtags, different types of comments (a tip: like and comment on pictures that are relevant to your account not just random posts for example I usually try to find bracelet posts or at least fashion type posts rather than just some random post).

8,"As many of y'all may already know, Instagram is moving to a strategy of sharing content based on an algorithm rather than a recency based feed. It's similar to the model that Facebook currently has.

The Facebook argument is that ""good content"" will be shown, and less quality content will be filtered from users. The counterargument  is that the user should choose who they want to follow and see rather than having the platform decide. 

**What I think will happen**

The content that gets good engagement on Facebook will be similar type of content that will be shown on Instagram (think meme's). The ability to build a brand &amp; look and feel for your company is going to the wayside. If you want your stuff to be seen in the future, you're going to have to pay for it. Branding content will be less effective for companies and they will now just focus on paying for CTA type of posts. User experiences will be compromised for IG profits.

**What I think Beardbrand will do**

I except to see a continued decline in the response to our posts to the point where only a couple hundred of our 100k followers will actually see our posts. We will continue to have a presence on Instagram, but we are not going to invest resources and brainpower into growing and engaging the audience. 

Because of that, we will double down on building out our blog www.urbanbeardsman.com and really focus on directing our audience to that website. Luckily for us, we saw this happening and have planned against it. I feel for companies who don't have the resources to build out their own blog.
