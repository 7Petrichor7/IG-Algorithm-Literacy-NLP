My best advice would be to find reels similar to the ones you are producing, and trying to work out exactly what it is they are doing that make them successful.

672,"To answer your question in detail here the risks:

1-You may get less visibility on Instagram.

Usually when you have an Instagram account Instagram allows people to find you easily through hashtags and literally shows your account to people if you broadcast frequent content and subject to a lot of interaction.
You lose this advantage if you buy followers.

2-You can get a shadow ban.
 
This means that your posts will only be visible to you.
Some people or even your whole community will not see your new posts.

3- total banishment
If your account represents a danger to its community through your posts and you boost it, you are automatically banned by Instagram.
Yes, it is forbidden by Instagram to buy subscribers, but the measures are only severe if you have an account that is deemed dangerous because you can negatively influence the entire Instagram community.
For example, I was selling adult items... 3 months ago and I saw my account literally banned by Instagram as soon as I boosted it.

Boosting your account doesn't only have drawbacks.
With the right strategies, you can even come out a winner.

As long as your account does not promote certain products and Instagram does not consider you dangerous in the worst case scenario, you will just have less visibility, but this disadvantage can be addressed if you are active or if you actively share your account on other social networks and among your subscribers there are some who are real and active.

Instagram tolerates you (The logic of my opinion is that ig thinks that despite  your boost, you don't harm and especially that you have a community that loves you then you will be less blocked. this is the case of several big celebrities)


For me, Instagram is a financial godsend and it's a shame to be deprived of social proof when you realize that people place a lot of importance on it when making a purchase decision.
Besides, when you adopt the right strategy, and you do business or have a monetizable site where you sell a product or just a blog where you do affiliate marketing, it's hyper free and highly qualified traffic.

I personally make all my sales from instagram.

My strategy is simple: 
I create my site.
I create an Instagram account for the site.
I make 3 posts on the product.
I buy subscribers on my account and likes on my posts.

Then I ask friends to share my Instagram account and I also share my Instagram account in facebook groups.
With a snowball effect I get traffic and sales on my product.


I don't recommend this strategy to those who would like to become an influencer because when you do an activity on Instagram and your growth is moderate, the Instagram algorithm naturally puts you forward and you have a good SEO. It takes time and you need to be active and interact a lot with your community but it is the best thing to do.

Personally, I'm expanding my account with booting and sharing on social networks and I'm taking my followers on this site:
www.boost-ig.com

I use this site to build my shop:
https://fr.shopify.ca/

You can write to me directly if you have an online store so we can exchange strategies on getting free traffic.

If you want a shop, I can also build one for you.;)
Here one of a shop I build for someone: www.jewelsmagics.com

But to get back to the topic of the post... Be sure to know what you want for the future of your account and I advise you not to boost your personal account but to create another account on which you will receive your followers.
This way you can avoid sanctions (because believe me, there are always sanctions even if you are tolerated you have to work harder on the short term because you lose a little bit of instagram support).

And beware of sites, there are some that don't deliver, others that make b***.

When you buy followers, always take the minimum number of followers that the site offers, and then you can test it and then you can decide what you want to do with it.

I hope this will shed some light on the subject.

It's a frustrating app that prioritizes big accounts, and the majority of users like simplistic images. Unless you want to change your style and focus on trendy Instagram art, you may need to put more effort into your Instagram presence. 

One issue I'm noticing is that you don't post on a regular schedule. The Instagram algorithm prioritizes posters who make content with some regularity. If you post multiple images a week, then skip posting for a few months, it'll be showing your posts to barely anyone.

Also, when your account is small, it's really easy to get drowned out by the vast amount of content. Try using hashtags with around 100k posts instead of tags with millions of posts.

Here are some reasons why you could suddenly be getting fewer likes on Instagram.

**Your Hashtags aren't working**

It's possible that you're choosing the wrong hashtags, using the wrong amount, or putting them in the wrong places.

**Instagram algorithm change**

The new Instagram algorithm chooses the order of the posts that users see when they're scrolling through their news feed. 

**Private account**

Setting your account to private on Instagram means that only people who follow you can see and engage with your content.

**Low-quality content**

Instagram can often reduce the quality of your images during uploads for a wide number of reasons, but if you're looking to maintain quality then you should look to upload a high-quality, compressed JPEG file.

 I've seen people often say ""you have to make art you don't like"", which simply isn't true. It's the artists who are more original that are likely to get more attention. I have seen a ton of digital artists that all make nearly the exact same type of art in a nearly identical style. Digital, anime style, illustration style, usually portraits. The problem is IG is often flooded with art like this, so people who make this specific kind of art will often get lost in the numerous other posts. No matter how much these type of artists interact it is very difficult to gain momentum on Instagram. 

You also have to utilize hashtags and post at specific times. Fortunately hashtags will show you how many other posts exist using that same tag, so it gives you an idea of just how popular that tag is. Posting at certain times of the day are also more likely to get you more foot traffic as well.

What might be happening, is that a relevant portion of your followers are made of ghost accounts, or low engaging accounts (people who aren't very active at the moment). 
Sometimes if your followers are mostly made of daily active users, the likes and interactions numbers would be bigger, that's because instagram algorithm doesn't make you get ""less likes"" such as youtube's algorithm does with their followers. Example: on youtube, if you as a content creator stop uploading for some time, you will get forgotten even if you upload back, because the algorithm will make you look like ""invisible"" for the followers, however that doesn't happen on instagram. You could disappear for a whole year, and when you get back, your upload will reach everyone like before.

Here are some reasons why you could suddenly be getting fewer likes on Instagram.

**Your Hashtags aren't working**

There are many possible reasons for Instagram hashtags not working. It's possible that you're choosing the wrong hashtags, using the wrong amount, or putting them in the wrong places. It's also possible that you've misused hashtags in a way that has caused your posts to be shadowbanned.

**Instagram algorithm change**

The new Instagram algorithm chooses the order of the posts that users see when they're scrolling through their news feed. Based on specific signals, it prioritizes the best posts, pushing the most relevant ones toward the top and giving them the most visibility, while other content ends up being placed further down.

**Wrong timing**

Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 11 am and Tuesday at 2 pm are now the best time to post on Instagram. Even weekends are good times to post on Instagram to get good engagement now, though they never used to compete. The worst time to post on Instagram is after 6 pm when individuals have finished work for the day.

**Private account**

Setting your account to private on Instagram means that only people who follow you can see and engage with your content. Even if you're using popular hashtags, your posts will still be hidden from those searches. It also means that any non-followers who want to see your content have to submit a follow request.

**Low-quality content**

Instagram can often reduce the quality of your images during uploads for a wide number of reasons, but if you're looking to maintain quality then you should look to upload a high-quality, compressed JPEG file (max resolution: 1080 x 1350px) directly from your mobile. You can upload your pictures from your computer using Deskgram, edit your photos with Canva, or go live from your PC or Mac using yellowduck .tv.

Instagram isn't causing you to get fewer followers. The reality is, there's no incentive for Instagram to intentionally change something in the app that causes users to not get likes. Try new things, be open to experiences. Consistency has always been, is, and will be the key to your engagement.",socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",,1615658191,2021-03-13 17:56:31,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking

Sounds like there's more than one thing going on here. 

It is important to write engaging captions, but you definitely don't want them to drag on. 60 - 100 words is usually a good bet. 

It can also help to occasionally ask your audience an engaging question to answer in the comments. Ideally, you want your audience to have a conversation with each other (and you) in your post's comments. 

That increased engagement will lead to an up-tic in your rating from the Instagram algorithm and therefore, your current and future Instagram account's reach. 

You can also use the [Caption Writer](https://captionwriter.app) app to plan out your captions and add line breaks so they look a bit cleaner. 

I hope this helps!

People give up, find themselves on their feed, 30 minutes later, Instagram has unknowingly hooked you, ,reeled you in, and studied you for 30 minutes. And if you were to ask Instagram about this issue of unopened DM \*laughter\* you wouldn't be able to contact them most likely, but if you're likely they will tell you the it's just a ""bug"" . This' my theory, and I don't think they will ever fix the bug even though they're richer than Argentina and Ecuador combined. Oh, sure, way I see it, they absolutely could fix this bug.

BLOG TEXT 1/3:

“Hello everyone! By this point it has been over 8 months since the cyberbullying began for Lillee Jean. Due to the fact there is a ton of misinformation, and a ton of people who simply want to bend the truth, we decided as a team to put together our own article, to support our point. Our point is not to hurt someone, but to put into perspective, you can’t go around spreading lies, and you can’t go around trying to harm an 18 year olds career as a hobby. Cyberbullying is not OKAY. Let’s begin.

In 2016/17, a forum started on Lillee Jean, via Reddit. Lillee had no idea this was going on, until a fan sent her a DM alerting her that people were talking harshly against her. From making fun of her eyes, to literally editing photos of her eyes gouged out with fake blood, 2016/17 was our first foray into “fame”. The thing is, Lillee Jean was a minor, sitting at 16, and the Reddit group was all men, who were talking harshly then fantasizing about Lillee in graphic ways. Reddit refused to remove the graphic photos these older men edited, in fact it took us contacting IMGUR the image hosting to actually get them removed. They were the first images when you searched Lillee’s name, and were extremely threatening to her. These men in retaliation started to comment all over Lillee’s Instagram picking on her following, her looks, just about everything. That’s called CYBERBULLYING. Following from platform to platform. We responded by blocking and reporting. The hurrah of their hate died out, within 2 weeks. It was silent, and Lillee went back to her blogging, and beauty content.

Flash forward to the Summer of 2019, Lillee was now 18. Doing her content, getting ready for the Fourth of July, and it began again. She got a DM from a fan alerting her that a Reddit forum talking harshly against her started up. Confused, Lillee alerted us, her team, and of course we checked it out. You can see some of the Reddit posts that the MODS took down here ( https://youtu.be/u-FzeOS_3Zs ). However, those same MODS also told the team to “fuck off” when I asked them nicely to take the forum down since the messages were so horrible that off-sprung from their BGC Chatter.



The main focus these people had was Lillee Jean getting PR.

“How could she deserve PR? I deserve it more I have more engagement. All her followers are fake I did an audit”.
This is a sampling of the summarization of their false accusations. Let’s begin. One, Lillee Jean in exchange for PR from brands she works with does free content. Almost everything you see unless it says AD or is mentioned paid, is unpaid. Why? Lillee likes to build organic relationships with brands. She has time to build her brand, and she wants to take that route. Now, debunking the IGaudit.IO — they sample only 500 followers AT A TIME, and then compare likes to other accounts. Are people a number now? IGAUDIT.IO is not only IO, Indian Ocean, an international program, it is not accurate. We use a paid program, HypeAuditor, which shows Lillee’s audience quality to be 699K+ real. It should be mentioned IGAUDIT.IO also gives you a different percentage each time you enter a username. Try it.

Enter Lolli Barr article from Whimm:  https://www.whimn.com.au/talk/people/the-curious-case-of-the-blogger-with-1-million-followers-who-nobody-knows/news-story/0755a54322bf5636d7b61fd5501f632d

Instagram also has had a bunch of ALGO updates, which to support this please visit these websites: https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-algorithm/ , https://www.thelovelyescapist.com/2018-instagram-algorithm/. So now, only 10% of your followers REALLY see your posts. Harsh reality.

Everything seemed fine, Lolli had written an article on Lillee Jean…all was quiet, then the “gurus” began again! Now, this is typical in beauty bloggers world’s, and celebs alike, BUT these people had a vendetta to “ruin” Lillee very early in her career. They began to say Lillee’s FANS were phony, and fake profiles. They claimed all of them were us, or Lillee, and falsely began claiming Lillee is a “transphobic and racist” girl. To put this blunt: We have NO CONTROL over a fans account. We have no control over what a fan SAYS. If a fan tags Lillee, or posts her, that’s great. We comment, we like, we send some love. However, it’s quite often a fan tells anecdotes about meeting a celeb, but you never see a photo with them together — it makes them feel good to get “one up” on other fans. Look at any Selena Gomez fanpage — it’s all Selena, some telling when they met her, but you never see that proof. Some major Gaga stans put Lady Gaga in their main profile feed from time to time. Thus, Gaga and Selena also have no control over that.

Lillee’s fans began getting harassed. Dm’d, told they are horrible, told they were Lillee, and told to stop following us. Some fans were upset and did unfollow Lillee. They felt cornered, harassed, and upset. Others went private like Lillee’s friend James. James, a good friend of ours, was also under fire. They claimed he used fake photos, and such. We have no control over what James like’s to do with his profile. It’s his profile, why not reach out to him? Thing is nobody did, expect blame him to the point he had enough and went private.

After this heated up, Lillee Jean began getting massive amounts of hate on her YouTube, her Instagram, and her Twitter. Making fun of her teeth, her eyes, her followers, basically LILLEE. They started to email her website, email her PRIVATE email, and the Redditors thought it was hysterical and said we were doing this. When provided with an IP of one sent to our email, they went silent. You can see this in her “I AM LILLEE JEAN” video — the IP is basically blurred, but you get the point. Thing is, before this went down, the Redditors started putting up Lillee’s address, before the MODS took it down. We felt threatened and unsafe.

Screenshotting, blocking and all that Jazz, Lillee in late August was then told a blogger was talking about her. This blogger, Lauren Elyse, put out a tweet on Lillee Jean.


She told them to go to a website called LOLCOW, which is a website where everyone is ANON, doxxes, and makes fun of others. 3 women, trans included committed suicide from the horrors this website brings. It’s not always the words, but the spreading of hate that goes platform to platform. It’s overwhelming. This website which many confuse, IS owned by Joshua Connor Moon, owner of Kiwifarms. Kiwifarms is as horrible, but worse. Kiwifarms housed the New Zealand shooter, and refused to give documentation to New Zealand.  If you can stomach it, they have put up Lillee Jean’s address, made fun of where she lives, and started up editing disgusting photos again. For all we know Lauren could be an LOL person, since everyone is ANON.",BeautyGuruChatter,"""instagram algorithm""",,1582006223,2020-02-18 6:10:23,,,

As far as I understand, the Instagram algorithm rewards **outgoing** engagement with **incoming** engagement. Engage with others and your posts will be made visible to more users.

Which means the best way of gaining followers in the early days is to make friends!

Find, follow, and chat to people who have similar follow counts to yours. Build a little community, do collabs, draw each others' characters, share each others' work in Stories. Soon you'll see that people who follow them will start following you, and vice versa.

Follower count and engagement with your media grow exponentially. Put in the hard work now to grow a following one human connection at a time, and that one human connection will mean 10 more followers, and those 10 followers will EACH give another 10 followers, etc.

It's about genuine interaction. Genuine followers will stay. Fake ass followers will flake.

Also try to post every day if you can. Even if it's just WIPs.

I've researched the Instagram algorithm recently (though it must be said things change every so often) and from what I can tell, IG rewards **outgoing** engagement with **incoming** engagement. The more you interact with others, the more visible IG will make your account/posts in the Explore section, and EVEN in your followers' feeds. IG actually hides your content from your own followers if you're not active on the platform. Yikes!

So go out and comment, chat, like, and share. Be active every day! And be patient.

1. Have a curated page. Make sure you stay consistent in the style of your posts. This doesn't mean you have to have a consistent art style, just a rhythm of posting. Like: art, inspiration, sketch and repeat. Keep the rhythm in twos or threes so the columns will line up whenever you post something new.

2. Post at least once per day. You can do more if you want, but just once is fine. Do so during peak Instagram hours so like 2-4pm.

3. Follow, like, and comment on similar accounts to yours from the explore tab. If you don't want to follow, that's fine, but definitely like and especially comment. The Instagram algorithm wants to see you active on Instagram and will then boost your posts in other people's recommendations

472,"A bad engagement is an indicator.   
I think the reasons might be different.  

  
Here are some reasons why you could suddenly be getting fewer likes on Instagram.  

**Your Hashtags aren't working**   
There are many possible reasons for Instagram hashtags not working. It's possible that you're choosing the wrong hashtags, using the wrong amount, or putting them in the wrong places. It's also possible that you've misused hashtags in a way that has caused your posts to be shadowbanned. 

  
**The  Instagram algorithm changes**  

The new Instagram algorithm chooses the order of the posts that users see when they're scrolling through their news feed. Based on specific signals, it prioritizes the best posts, pushing the most relevant ones toward the top and giving them the most visibility, while other content ends up being placed further down.    


**Wrong timing** 

Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 11 am and Tuesday at 2 pm are now the best time to post on Instagram. Even weekends are good times to post on Instagram to get good engagement now, though they never used to compete.  

  
**Low-quality conten**

t Instagram can often reduce the quality of your images during uploads for a wide number of reasons, but if you're looking to maintain quality then you should look to upload a high-quality, compressed JPEG file (max resolution: 1080 x 1350px) directly from your mobile. You can upload your pictures from your computer using Deskgram, edit your photos with Canva, or go live from your PC or Mac using yellowduck .tv.",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1621112048,2021-05-15 20:54:08,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking

It may be wise to simply start a new account, because if you've bought into fake followers, chances are there are a lot of other things you haven't done quite right. (No offense, of course).

Buying any of those things is some kind of short term investment that will usually bite you in the ass, and most people who do regret it later.

When this happens it means your posts don't appear in your followers feeds or are not prioritised so they are unlikely to see them, therefore, less likes for you. There's a couple of ways to fix this and 'reset' the algorithm for you such as: 

\- when you next share an important post ask close friends to like and comment on it straight away, that way it will then become prioritised in other followers feeds and hopefully get even more likes.

\- try posting questions that encourage comments and engagement, make it as easy as possible for people to answer if your account is publishing, for example, posting &gt; what's your favourite book or tag someone you would send X book to. Tag to win competitions could also work well for you. 

\- same with stories ask a really easy question or use the poll sticker to get engagement. I find that quizzes or true/false voting type stories work really well. 

\- try messaging your new followers a simple welcome message via DM or commenting on their recent post. The more you interact with your followers, the higher up in their feeds your posts will appear which should result in more engagement.

Because Hollow Knight is a game on Steam, you could also post your work there too and find potential buyers from there.

Here are some reasons why you could suddenly be getting fewer likes on Instagram.    
Your Hashtags aren't working 

  
There are many possible reasons for Instagram hashtags not working. It's possible that you're choosing the wrong hashtags, using the wrong amount, or putting them in the wrong places. It's also possible that you've misused hashtags in a way that has caused your posts to be shadowbanned.   
**The  Instagram algorithm changes**    
The new Instagram algorithm chooses the order of the posts that users see when they're scrolling through their news feed. Based on specific signals, it prioritizes the best posts, pushing the most relevant ones toward the top and giving them the most visibility, while other content ends up being placed further down.    
**Wrong timing**   
Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 11 am and Tuesday at 2 pm are now the best time to post on Instagram. Even weekends are good times to post on Instagram to get good engagement now, though they never used to compete.    
**Low-quality content**  
t Instagram can often reduce the quality of your images during uploads for a wide number of reasons, but if you're looking to maintain quality then you should look to upload a high-quality, compressed JPEG file (max resolution: 1080 x 1350px) directly from your mobile.

I will answer your comments:

1. The Instagram algorithm is designed so that authors with a large number of subscribers get more user attention.

The Carusel algorithm is designed so that more exciting publications get more user attention.

2. The user can select the categories (tags) that he wants to see first. This will help him get the content he needs. But he will choose categories independently, and they will not be imposed in any way. For example, based on the action history, as Instagram does.

3. ""Heartless Algorithm"" because our algorithm is clearer, we do not impose categories (tags) and, as a result, do not lock users in the filter bubble. But I agree that this is not the best expression, which has a strong emotional component. We will work on our text.

4. Regarding the minuses Instagram. I agree with you regarding the NSFW filter on Instagram, and we solve this problem in Carusel. But we cannot have issues with ShadowBan and Throttling. The Carusel algorithm is designed so that it was almost impossible to promote content using bots. You can support the publication only by receiving a post at random. Clicking on a direct link the user will not be able to affect the rating of the publication. Therefore, we will not need to ban users in this way.

325,"The first question I ask for you is, Are you still posting as much as you used to in the past?
Also over time random bots follow you and they don't engage on posts. So that hurts engagement as well because the Instagram algorithm sees that you have a certain number of followers and within the first hour of posting is the most important for engagement. If engagement in likes and comments is around the same as in the past, then the algorithm won't give you a bigger push out to more people because of your like to follow ratio.
Also take into account how you use hashtags. Hashtags play a huge part to reaching more people. But if you use the 30 max hashtags on every single post the Instagram algorithm may mark it as spammy. I recommend using 28 hashtags every now and than. It's the safe number of hashtags to reach people still, but stay under the spam radar.

But with a new account you have the choice to handpick the people you want to cater to, and again both would be slow growth, but there's a difference to the growth.

There is a website for this or with an alternate account try searching your username and your account should show up in results. Shadow bans often occur from the spamming of the same hashtags or usage of banned hashtags. Second of all, whether you are shadow banned or not you never want to use the same hashtags and it’s clear that your set of hashtags hasn’t been working out so I would ditch the set your using and find 3 good sets of hashtags that fit your niche of content and try those out cycling the hashtags.

Sometimes I just get way less likes/views on posts, it’s just Instagram deciding if it wants to push your content out or not. I will say one other thing, I don’t know how many followers your account has but if it’s under around 600-1000 you might want to do the follow unfollow method. Although this is an unhealthy method Instagram won’t push out content of super dead pages or pages with just not many followers regardless if you have good hashtags or not. Example: on my account I started from scratch before it hit 1k followers, like 4 out of my 40 posts got over 15k views it’s still random at that stage in a way.

In my opinion ATM stories are the king, And it seems that the IG algorithm is love them.
New post? Announce it with a story. 
For that 3 minute video, go to Reels. And as someone said above, add a story to announce it.
Live are also a good way to boost algorithm, but prepare audience for live.
Make sure your audience knows when you go live (advertise the live through your posts/stories).
Make a plan before your live, like: think how you'll interact with audience, and schedule the live when most of your audience is online (i can give a tool suggestion for that).

Also the tool mentioned before will shows you the audience habits and how interact with your content types (so that you can discover how conceptual differences between IG content types are applied specific on your audience)",InstagramMarketing,"""ig algorithm""",,1610257621,2021-01-10 5:47:01,sensemaking,,

What do you mean use the use hashtags? If you mean this: Don’t use all of the same hashtags on other posts. That is spam in the Instagram algorithm.

There are different benefits when it comes to putting hashtags in the post description and/or comments. If you put the hashtags in the post you can edit them later on to more related hashtags to the post to gain even more engagement. Putting them in the comments makes your description look less spammy and also counts as a comment engagement on your post.
Or you could do a little bit of both. I do 5 hashtags under the description and the rest in the comments. I do a total of 28 hashtags to get a good reach with them while also staying under the Instagram algorithm spam radar.

Always use geo-location tag in posts and stories to reach more people. I use the hashtag overlay in story and also 2 other hashtags shrunk down and hidden behind hashtag overlay so it doesn't over flood the story post.

The max hashtags for a story is 10, but I've done multiple tests with using different numbers of hashtags 10 and below in stories. Found that 3 was the most effective for me at least. Sometimes rank on all 3.

1. Post more videos - Videos tend to go more viral and hit the explore page more than regular picture posts

2. Encourage your followers to comment - Ask a question in your caption or say something like “Tag someone who loves __________ (something related to your niche). Do this because early engagement is key to hitting the explore page.

3. Post viral content people have not seen before - Repost some things off YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, or even TikTok. If your audience sees something they have never seen before, they are likely to engage with it more.

4. Post valuable content - Get people to share the post and save it. Saves and shares are valued more than likes and comments in the Instagram algorithm.

275,"After some testing, we found out what works on Instagram.
  

  
Here are our 4 tricks that helped us grow our account organically, without any paid ads and advertising budget.
  

  
1. Engage with your current followers
  

  
Show your followers that you are interested in their content and that you care about them.
  

  
Comment and like your followers' photos to make your content more accessible and visible to your followers. Write genuine and thoughtful comments longer than four words and avoid answering only with emojis.
  

  
Extra tip: The more engagement you obtain within the first 30 minutes, the Instagram algorithm will work for you and show your post to more of your followers.
  

  
2. Follow active users in your niche
  

  
Search for active users similar to you and follow them. This way, you have a better chance that they will be interested in your content and follow you back.
  

  
3. Ask questions
  

  
Ask questions in the photo description and show people that you care for their opinion. This is another great way to increase engagement. As soon as your followers respond, be fast and proactive, and write a comment within a few minutes for a better ranking.
  

  
4. Explore relevant hashtags
  

  
Research relevant and popular hashtags. In the search bar, write a hashtag you use in your photos and comment on the images you find. This way, users looking for the particular content will find you easier, and some of them will most likely check your profile, start to follow you, and engage with your content.

Should I care more about how this would show up in our everyday life—for example, the time she has to spend on photo shoots? Should I be worried about our future—what happens if she gets blocked from Instagram, or loses popularity and no longer has an income stream? Or should I be most concerned about the ethics of this?

A few things for you to consider, especially if your profile is supposed to be about you:

* **Optics:** Maxing out the 30 hashtags looks thirsty. 
   * By extension, using #running when you're posting about a barbecue is disingenuous and that algorithm might flag you for spam
* **Ownership:** Hashtags on basic verbs and adjectives directs their attention away from you.
   * If you're going to hashtag—especially for a profile that encompasses all you do—make them unique to you. This allows your audience to follow YOUR journey.
      * \#Archie6969Grills: For your BBQ content
      * \#Archie6969Runs: For your running content
* **The API:** Granted, this is a bit more meaningful if you care about data, reporting and insights, but Instagram shut down their API for any really valuable info. Professionally, that's what told us it wasn't that important to the platform anymore, but only remaining because it was an established audience behavior.",socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",,1559054563,2019-05-28 14:42:43,,,

Combine that with ""virality potential"" (i.e. the more people who like your post in the first 5 to 10 minutes of it being up, the more there is a chance Instagram will show it to more people), and you have the algorithm and how it works.

233,"No problem.

Again, I'm beginner but I can share my insights. I'm very picky when it comes to following accounts and I reflect that to the following.

1. Post quality. Definitely. A single post of yours is usually the first thing someone sees.  So that must be good in order to make the person stop scrolling and visit your profile.
2. Profile presentation. Now that the person has come to your profile it must look like it's worth following. Bio: I think it should be short and clean. Nobody reads it if there is your full life story, at least I don't. I have in my bio, first row: 6 words long wordplay about my username, second row: a couple words about what my account is about, third row: flag emojis to indicate what languages I speak. Another thing the visitor sees in your profile are your pics. I think it looks much better when you have a consistent theme. No matter if it's black&amp;white, colorful, chessboard etc. as long as it is consistent. The theme can of course change over time, I don't think it's bad if you post 12 black&amp; whites and then change to colorful and back again, as long as it's not all over the place and mixed up.
3. Captions, name, profile pic. This is a bit same as post quality when it comes to attracting people to visit your profile. When someone stops scrolling at your pic these can make the difference. As I said in my last comment: I think that people are more prone to visit profiles which have a name and profile pic related to the niche they are targeting. People only see the first two lines of your captions, so those should attract to click 'more'. Usually people love stories, experiences, jokes etc. But keep them short so they take the time to read it. Long captions might work when your audience know you better.
4. Engagement. I've understood that IG algorithm loves engagement. The more engagement in your posts - the more exposure they get. Caption should encourage the audience to comment. I don't like those ""like this if.."" and ""comment if..."" captions, I never like or comment in those, but many people do. So you never know. My style is more making a relatable captions, like ""Man it's always a struggle finishing these walnut birdhouses. Have you ever got the feeling that the wood has the mind of it's own? Well I do. Often."" Liking and commenting others' posts is good way to make them see you. Here again, name and profile pic can make the difference. If you don't like commenting, at least answer to the comments in your posts. 
5. Hashtags. I left this last but it's important too. You asked "" why not include another 10-15 more?"". Tbh I don't see any reason why not to, if you can come up with that amount of relevant hashtags. I can't. It's good to check what kind of posts are under those hashtags you use. For example, if I post a birdhouse made out of mapletree it doesn't mean that #mapletree is a good hashtag. I might get some reach but the audience is completely wrong. That affects your engagement ratio which to my knowledge is quite important. So quality over quantity. Furthermore, when I'm exploring and see posts that are under a completely wrong hashtag, I don't get good impression about the account. Probably I don't remember it afterwards but I might. 
6. Engagement again. I think that engaging with your audience becomes more important the more you grow. Helps to keep the followers, good for the algorithm and shows visitors that you care, have the time to answer etc.

I don't know if that is a good ranking or if you even can rank those things, because they overlap a bit and are related to bit different things which are all important. (reach, first impression, engagement...)

No, people aren't upset about this because they deserve more engagement, they're upset about it cause everyone wants likes and followers, and everyone thinks their content is amazing and deserves attention.

Yes, not all popular content is good art. But alternately, just because you make content that has artistic merit, that's no reason to expect people are going to vibe with it. 

This isn't about IG, it's about content. If it's awesome content and it's relevant, unique, and compelling, and fits into something there is an audience for, people are going to pay attention.

When there were 20 people on it, you have a fair chance to win. When there's 2 billion, it's close to impossible. And the censorship on Instagram will only get worse and worse.

My advice is simply ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"". Instagram is done, is terrible, is unfair, is against the artist spirit, but there's nothing we can do to stop it. The Instagram algorithm decides who get popular and who's not, it's not about the quality of your content anymore, it's purely luck. However, if you keep on focusing on the negative part, you might miss out on other opportunities. Remember, before Instagram, there's facebook. Before Facebook, there's My Space.

A new addition to the algorithm. It seems at the moment many upgrades are occurring , so certain behaviors liking, posting, following, that were ok before could be getting flagged now.

Also Instagram seems sloppy with their rollouts so maybe people who aren’t the target still get penalized 

This time very much reminds me of 2012 when Google began restricting link farms and scrapped sites. 

Before that people would built 100’s of crappy sites , with automatically stollen content ( called scrapping) which would slightly edit the text. They would link all of these sites together and they would get a higher PR - page rank. 

Users could measure PR with a browser tool bar. And if your site got a link from a high PR site your own rank would go up.

So link farms would interlink 100’s of sites and sell the links for $$ 

A whole industry was born. 

In 2012 Google developed and released 2 algorithms they added to their main algorithm. 

Panda and Penguin - 2 animals that were black and white - for white hat and black hat actions.

Panda could detect low quality content
Penguin could detect unnatural links.

So many forums, directories, blogs and link farms began to fall from the ranks and so many people were shocked.

Because Google much like Instagram didn’t and still doesn’t provide much documentation on rules of the algorithm, most of the content online about SEO was user generated from what worked and what you could get away with.

It really feels like a similar thing is going on with the Instagram algorithm right now.

Its part of hiw Instagram algorithm works, photos are organized relative to time of upload withing the first 60 seconds, so adding it as part of the first comment drops the organisation for each of those keywords, especially with the popular tags, so adding the tags after the fact put you in order behind anyone else who got in with tags before tou

When testing on my own accounts images where I put the tags in as comments dropped engagement by nearly 70% relative to the accounts avg, I left those images up for 2 days, then removed them and reuploaded them with the tags as part of the description and they got more engagement within the first hour than it had in the 2 days with the tags in the comment and in the end received the avg engagement for the accounts.

I have however noticed this is less of an issue for accounts with high numbers of followers, I suspect 5hat has to do with the lack of need for generic exposure, most of my accounts have between  1 and 2k followers, so they need generic exposure to gain traction.

Your Instagram feed isn’t just based on who you follow, it’s also based on who and what you like.

The more the Instagram algorithm thinks you will “like” that post, the higher it will appear in your feed.

This is based on “past behavior on similar content and potentially machine vision analyzing the actual content of the post.”

So basically, what you see in your Instagram feed is a combination of all of your Instagram behaviors. The friends you interact with the most, who’s stories you watch, people you are tagged in photos with, and of course, the type of posts that you like and comment on.""",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1600559531,2020-09-19 23:52:11,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking

2. Instagram measures how fast and how often that small percentage of your audience engages (likes, comments, shares and saves) with your post and it compares the engagement of your new post to the engagement of previous posts of yours, on similar days and times.
If it is getting less engagement than your average, the post is shown to a smaller percentage of your audience and it’s shown farther down on their home page = less people see your posts and discover your page.
3. If the post is getting more engagement than your average, then a larger percentage of your audience sees it and the higher it appears on people’s home feeds, as well as having a higher likelihood of being shown on other Explorer Pages = more people see your posts and discover your page.",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1516762746,2018-01-24 2:59:06,,,sensemaking

sadly IG algorithm is really unforgiving and mysterious, I've gone viral just once, got like 12k likes and a bunch of followers in a fanart of Hollow Knight and after that it started to go down again, even when I posted frequently. I don't understand how it works despite reading about it a lot, and honestly uploading frequently is really hard and a chore, I now do it whenever I want since I really didn't see an increase in followers or likes for months after that, if you want to do it the cheap way, go to the profile of a big artist your art is similar and follow his followers, some of them will follow you back. 

I don't use Twitter a lot but if you don't have a lot of active followers, I found it's really hard to get noticed and you'll need people with a lot of followers to share your post to get a chain of shares going on, otherwise it's like shouting into the void, fanart is great if you get a big account to share your tweet.

Some of the changes I've heard about through my research lately include:

- You should engage within 60 mins. This is due to Instagram wanting the platform to be a place of engagement, rather than just posting photos and disappearing. If you get comments on your post within an hour, it's highly suggested to engage and comment back. To show that you're a real person.

- 30 hashtags are too many. Apparently now, if you use the full 30 tags, you'll be considered spam and shadowbanned. It's been suggested to use 5-10 tags only (in the body of the post, not first comment). And also, use different tags for each post. 
Because of the new feature to follow hashtags, I guess IG wants quality posts ( and not constant spam) so that users don't feel turned off by following hashtags.

- Pods/Engagement Groups could have adverse effects. IG has developed a way to understand if you use pods (this has been alleged for a while now). So it's being said that the use of comment pods may be detrimental.",socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",,1516773346,2018-01-24 5:55:46,,,

So you have to build relationships with your audience by posting and engaging consistently, which is really dependent on what's most sustainable for you to produce on a regular cadence.  
* **Interest:** If a user has engaged with a type of post in the past, then the algorithm is more likely to show that type of post to someone in the future.

The average engagement rate for accounts is 2-3% so on a 6k account that should be 180 like for a 3% engagement rate. Now something when buying you should check through the likes to see if there are too many accounts with blanks or people who have only a few followers. This can mean fake likes. You can also check comments on recent and past posts to see if their are repeats or generic comments.  These could be fake comments. Also powerlikes do work but it depends on several factors. For some clients I have used powerlikes on they have gained 10k followers, and with others they have gained 0. Power likes essentially if you have a good account pushes your picture into the feeds of your current followers and this expands to their followers etc to help you get to explore page. Instagram algorithm changes so often that powerlikes have lost some of their drastic growth benefits but still can be useful.

Maybe there are other reasons why your traffic dropped, for example, maybe recently your content just was not relevant enough and other accounts in your niche have been creating content that is more engaging and more relevant for your audience and therefore they got exposed and you didn't.

What makes sense based on my experience with the Google algorithm is that your account has been ""hit"" almost at once because your authority rank was recalculated by the Instagram algorithm and dropped (it's a made-up term, there is no official term or any data about how the Instagram algorithm works).

Anyway the only suggestion I can make to you is try to figure out what is it that your competitors are doing that is working better than yours and do more of that. You can analyze it manually or using a software (viralspy or any other software).

165,"It is likely that the Instagram algorithm works in somewhat similar way to the Google algorithm. The way Google works is that every time that you index a new page to its search engine, which is similar to posting a new post on Instagram, it decides how much exposure to give it first according to your authority as a brand and then according to the engagement of the people that got exposed with the content.

The second part of the engagement with the post usually doesn't make such dramatic drops in traffic in Google, that's because the engagement with your content typically stays in a defined range that your brand authority has (in Google it's called the domain authority or domain rank by the way).

What sometimes cause in Google such major drops, which wouldn't be surprising to be the same reason for Instagram, is an update to the ranking algorithm that suddenly reduces the rank of your domain dramatically.

With a lower the main rank, your posts gets less exposure to begin with. If it works the same in social media (which unlike Google no one really knows) it might have been the case where your account authority dropped and then the range of minimum and maximum exposure that you can get no matter how good is your content dropped as well.

The good news is that it is probably possible to grow back your accounts authority by creating high quality content. Consider engaging in more research of what other accounts in your niche are doing that works well, you can analyze their best performing posts manually or using a software (not just viralspy, there are at least a couple of them in the market). Either way, doing that would make sure that you're taking a data driven approach for content creation, and data driven decision making is always good for business.",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",sensemaking,1634259098,2021-10-15 0:51:38,,,

In the contrary, if you use the system like it is supposed to be used, like engaging with genuine followers, posting relevant hastags, using all the features properly (hashtags or location, but also stories and IGTV), then it will properly help Instagram ( and their AIs), knowing proper things about people, recognizing images thanks to hashtags etc. You help them, they help you, by giving you more visibility.

163,"So I don’t know how much you know, so if you know this don’t mind my little recap. When IG started, posts were shown chronological, so of all the people you followed you were shown the newest posts first. IG moved away from that a while back and went toward a more algorithmic way of showing you posts.

&gt;[When Instagram first broke news of the new algorithm, they commented, “The order of photos and videos in your feed will be based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post.”](https://later.com/blog/how-instagram-algorithm-works/).

So in theory, if you like your best friends’ photos more, or your mom’s photos, or Rach Parcell’s photos, you will see that content first. You are also more likely to see content that has been highly liked and interacted with above lesser liked content. For example, when I log onto the app, I see my best friends’ photos first and meme photos, because I always like the memes posted by accounts like KaleSalad and I interact more with my friends’ pages by liking their posts, and leaving comments and watching their stories. 

Bloggers were complaining that the algorithm was negatively affecting them, since their posts were being hidden/buried instead of shooting to the top of the feed. There are a lot of articles out there if you google “Instagram algorithm” including the one that I linked that discuss how to up your engagement. That is why bloggers are asking you to like their photos, or comment, or respond to their polls, or watch their IG stories. If you follow Rach Parcell and interact with her account in those ways, she is going to skyrocket to the top of your feed. 

Bloggers were calling for the algorithm to be done away with and wanting to go back to the chronological feeds. I’m not really sure why, I would think that with the algorithmic feeds they were actually getting more engagement? But clearly not if they were all whining about it. 

So Instagram is transitioning away from a totally algorithmic feed and more toward a chronological one. 

At the same time LikeToKnowIt has been transitioning as well. In the past, bloggers were getting increased engagement because you have to like their photos to get the product info emailed to you. Now, LikeToKnowIt has done with away with actually having consumers “like” posts. Instead, you have to screenshot the post and then I think import the screenshot into the LTKI app. So suddenly these bloggers are getting less likes. And coupled with that, I think engagement has gone down a ton. 

Sarah Tondello was complaining last night on IG stories about why people aren’t liking her posts. LoverlyGrey was on stories asking why if people like her feed they won’t click like on her content itself. She is asking you to like her photos, even if you don’t like the individual content.

For a lot of them it feels performative, especially if they're doing the bare minimum of reposting a couple stories other influencers or activists compiled. They want the head pats and basically permission to return to LTKing their feeds so they just check the box of ""doing something.""

If they have taken more time to look into the accounts they're sharing and actually expand on why they're promoting them it feels more genuine. e.g. for me Mackenzie Horan has donated, matched donations, and actually wrote a little paragraph intro to all the women she was sharing. It seemed like she actually spent time and research doing so. And they were some great accounts that the IG algorithm just doesn't promote to me, so I was glad to find them, too. This felt genuine.

I think it's important to continue to promote BIPOC accounts, content, businesses, etc. because if we're trying to shift as a society it has to continue forever, not just this week.

From a purely technical standpoint, there is no point in using less than 30 hashtags. Your post will be broadcast to more people outside your followers, it's a fact.  
From a crowd standpoint you may find out that your target audience dislike posts with hashtags, or dislikes posts with too many hashtags...  
Putting hashtags in comments serve two purposes: 1) It hides the hashtag from the main post when people are just browsing thru their timelines, if you get enough comments on ""hide it"".  2) It fools instagram when your account has been flagged/soft-banned.  
  
Now, I really see no reason for not using hashtags at all. Some of my posts, because of content (nude art) don't get picked upon the hashtags I've provide, I lose 30% engagement this way and my account starts to decline because I don't get new followers.  
For the last 2 weeks I've stopped baiting followers by liking other people/commenting/following and everytime my post with hashtags don't get broadcasted, I end up the day with less followers than I've started.

Depression and despair are real and powerful things, but they also massively distort your perceptions and judgment and lead you to think things about the world that simply aren't true. The world is better with you in it.

Now, with that out of the way, some of the discouragement your feeling is common to many artists, even those who have a full time job making art.

With my greatest sensitivity and support, it sounds like this art dream is consuming too much of your life. While it's true that ""real"" artists will make art regardless of whether anyone else takes notice, you can't have a healthy life, of even a productive art practice, if art is the only thing you do or think about. The way your post is written, it sounds like you have no hobbies, no social life, no downtime. Those are essential parts of being a healthy human being and a perceptive artist. I know it may seem like having coffee with friends or going on a bike ride won't contribute to your health as an artist, but they do.

It also allows you to take the pressure off a bit, which sounds like something you absolutely need. If all you ever do is try to be an artist and you encounter any frustration or delay at all, it's hard not to feel like literally everything you've ever done is a waste. Yes, you need to be focused, and consistent, and dedicated,, but you seem like you're living your life only for art, which is bound to lead to disappointment, even if you start getting some of the success you're seeking.

As others have said, it sounds like you're spending a lot of time following what's popular and trying to swim with the current. My guess is that you've posted a drawing of Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, or of Baby Yoda, or any number of other oversaturated themes and subjects. The best artists stand out because they do their own thing. Even if they don't, no one is going to follow you based off of a picture that's sitting on a hashtag page with a hundred other drawings an hour. I love doing Inktober and Junetoon and all the stuff like that, but it's never been a driver of followers.

Rather than pouring energy into trying to game the IG algorithm, focus instead on building your art practice. If we all spent as much time improving our drawing and painting skills as we did on researching hashtags and the best time of day to post, we'd all be much better (and popular) artists. Also don't discount the importance of face-to-face networking. I joined a few local life drawing sessions a few years ago and it's helped my art skills and given me good contacts who are earning a full time living as artists.

Pro's - 

- using the example of my Fashion portfolio page, people are more likely to follow you if you have over 1k followers, especially photographers, Model etc, that might be looking to work with you, as you look more popular, this include more people trying to engage with you trying to work with you

Cons -

You actually get less likes and less engagement, so for example, before if you had 100 followers and you put out a new post, it might show it to 30 random people, bare in mind that these 30 people are genuine organic followers, so they are much more likely to like/comment, which means it shows it to more and more people because the % of likes to followers is greater, so it thinks it's a good post.
Now say you've paid for 1k followers, and you upload a post, it might show it to 50 people, but most of these people won't engage with you at all. So the Instagram algorithm thinks your post is a bit shit. If even your followers arnt engaging, why would it try and show it to anybody new, so it's harder to gain new engagement, and more organic followers

This actually means you are gaining loads of followers, but actually getting less likes, which doesn't look good, and people can actually see you are paying for followers,

One of the most powerful ways to blow up your Instagram is to get a post featured on the Instagram Explore Page.

What exactly does “blow up your Instagram” mean, anyway?

Well…

You go from this:

 This translates into massive exposure for your brand or business, a big boost in user engagement, and hundreds to thousands of new followers.

With the rate that Instagram changes the rules and tweaks its algorithm, it can be easy to start feeling a little hopeless — **but I’m here today to show you how crazy results like those above are possible.**

What’s an Instagrammer with a small following to do?

How do you get heard amidst all the noisy competition?

**Many “experts” out there talk about how you need to** ***fight*** **the** **Instagram algorithm****,** so you can keep your exposure up on the platform.

*But they’ve got it completely wrong.*

You don’t need to *fight* the Instagram algorithm—**you need to USE the algorithm to get onto the Instagram Explore Page and get crazy good results.**

 You can USE the algorithm to get onto the Instagram Explore Page.

 

What exactly is the Explore Page anyway, and how do you use it to your advantage?

**The Instagram Explore Page is an incredibly powerful feature,** one that can help you gain a MAJOR boost to your exposure with minimal effort if you know how to get one of your posts to land on it. Its main function is to help users find the content that they like the most.

**It’s also the secret many big accounts use to blow up their accounts and grow their following at a staggering pace.** With millions of users posting content to Instagram every day, getting your content on the Explore Page may seem like a tall order. Though it does require a bit of luck in addition to careful strategizing, it isn’t all that difficult to do, even with a small account.

In this in-depth guide, we’ll dive into exactly what the Explore page is for, how it works, and how you can get featured on it in order to reap the benefits.

 

## What is the Instagram Explore Page and Where to Find it

You can find the Instagram Explore page by tapping on the magnifying glass icon in the menu at the bottom of your screen within the app.

Though the Explore page is different for every single user, it’s filled with an array of many different posts. **The content here is made up of things you’ve recently liked as well as posts liked by people whose content you’ve liked.**

 

When your followers double tap and like your Instagram posts, your post will now show up on the Explore page of users following *them*. Therefore, the more people you get to like your content, the more people will see it, and in turn even more people will like your content (increasing your chances of blowing up your Instagram — hooray for positive feedback loops!).

This snowball effect is how your post can go viral by utilizing the huge network effect of your followers and all their followers combined. This can lead to a huge boost in new followers who find you after your content shows up on their Explore Page feed.",socialmedia,"""instagram algorithm""",,1602154558,2020-10-08 10:55:58,,,

But in general, I do not do much in regard to my followers. If they want to follow me without commenting, then it is their choice.

But I am absolutely trying to clean up in the list of people I follow. I am getting rid of people I do not know, that do not fit with what I am doing and that do not give me inspiration etc. that do not follow me.

There are of course some of them that I will keep, no matter what. Family, friends, colleagues etc. And some big accounts that I really do not expect will ever follow me back :-) Yes, I do not expect an account with several tens of thousands of followers to follow me back unless I know them personally.

So in general - I do not worry too much about who is following me. I am thinking more about who I am following. Because that directly influences the Instagram algorithm.",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1565714009,2019-08-13 16:33:29,,,

You're correct in thinking this.  

To expand further, using highly popular hashtags hurt your the most from what I've read and also observed in my experience.  Examples such as #love #happy #dog #pets are all generic; highly used tags that are sought after by bots.  Those bots like, comment (usually just emoji's), and follow you, then after a day or two, the bot auto unfollows you.  This is called the follow/unfollow method that millions of user's use every day to grow their accounts. (I guess it's worth noting that it's not just bots do the f/uf method, accounts without bots do this all the time as well.)

I personally don't like this method as I want to have as genuine of a following as I can.  This method also hurts your engagement rate which plays a huge part in the Instagram algorithm.

3. Do you genuinely believe IG is able to keep up with deleting fake accounts and spam accounts?

4. IG doesn’t remove inactive accounts. If you haven’t been online for a year or more, it doesn’t make them delete it, so what is your point with me “wasting my time” by doing it myself? 

5. The IG algorithm is build up to show your posts to a certain number of followers. The engagement of those followers sets the base for how many from the explorer page/hashtags the post will be shown to.

I mean all these videos are merely self predictions or information from some tech websites. I studied other videos while I’m collecting information. Apparently, these people that constantly upload algorithm updates are recycling their old information that changes are happening without concrete evidence. It is a business.

My algorithm explanation are based on personal experience with the app rather than the general impression, so most of my videos are giving information based on facts and confirmed update. I don’t sell courses or powerlikes so I don’t have to push my agenda so hard. For that reason, I am actually impress how everyone make algorithm updates every month and when it isn’t even official.

Said that, Instagram is making way too many changes and apparently desperately pushing it as the new Facebook. New features that stir my interest: voice &amp; video calling, reposting to stories.

Although Stories has become bigger but I predict it will decline quickly for some undisclosed reason. There are too many new features going on and it is not cool anymore. It is congested. The only thing that really drive people’s attention is POLL and Live stream.

As far as art to buy and hang up on your wall is concerned, people prefer things to be more expressive. People will ooh and ahh over a photo-realistic portrait or landscape, but most people would prefer less realistic paintings with more “feeling” to them. But it all really depends on your type of art in particular. Remember that when trying to sell art, what matters most is making something that people can see up on their wall.

In all seriousness, though, I do have to say that chasing Instagram engagement seems to bring young artists more misery than anything else. It makes you try to make art because you want strangers to like it instead of because it makes you happy, and that makes a lot of artists incredibly anxious, especially when you are just starting out.

The IG algorithm attempts to understand the relationships between users posting in order to generate content that the user will be drawn to the most.

The longer the time spent on Instagram correlates to more engagement between users which can be seen in the algorithm when Instagram favors posts that have more..

Top posts may also differ very slightly for each user I believe.     
 
I'm not sure if there is an official source on how it works, but I believe it works like this myself:  
  

Traffic that is generated through the hashtag specifically will rank higher. For example, if I posted an image with two hashtags, #Hash1 and #TagA
And 90% of people found my post using #Hash1, then my post, even though it has more likes than anything else on #TagA, it will not be in #TagA top posts.    
  
In regards to the historic portion: hashtags gain popularity over time, so an image doing very well while the hashtag was not very popular gives it a boost in being selected for the top posts. While an image doing well on a popular hashtag may not be outperforming other images using the same hashtag.  
   
On top of this, it probably works the same as trending, where say Image 1 got 500 likes in 1 hour and then trailed off for a total of 1000 likes over the next week, that image would trend better than Image 2 which got 1000 likes over 24 hours and 2000 likes over the week.

I have to agree with you. I often post short videos on Instagram and I get a lot of followers and engagement. But Instagram is different from TikTok and that's why they make their way to the Explore page. Just to give you an example, one of my last short videos got 66k impressions, 57k from which came from the Explore page. So, it is definitely possible. I don't think that IG algorithm values the duration of the video more than the engagement it receives. 

Plus, I've noticed that my videos start getting people from the Explore page between the 3rd-10th day of the initial post. 

Short videos are a thing because they are more catchy (compared to long videos, where users have to watch most of it to get to the point) which is great for grabbing the attention of the regular viewer. Plus, most people are willing to watch short videos more than once. Cannot say the same about a 30 sec. video. 

But don't get me wrong. I think longer videos can also work on Instagram. But they have to be of pretty good quality, engaging and interesting to your followers. The cover of the video is also important. Ultimately, you want to share them when you already  have a stable foundation of followers.

You don’t have to quit social media to avoid influencer marketing, though. 

The Instagram algorithm knows the content you engage with, so if 90% of what you’re seeing is marketing from influencers, it’s because you’ve chosen to follow influencers and engage with that kind of content.

I only follow family, friends, and a few cat-related accounts on my IG, and that’s basically all I see (on my regular feed and explore page).

**1. Interactive:**

Create a *NARRATIVE* on IG Stories. Have a flow in stories by documenting the behind-the-scenes footage.

**2. Relevance:**

Post stories that are *RELEVANT* either niche, followers or something personal. E.g. health problem etc. Post timely things like internet trends.

**3. Ask for suggestions:**

IG story *poll* and *emoji slider poll* are the ways to go. Create an *ENGAGING* environment for IG community.

**4. Shoutout:**

Create a story with your post (*RESHARE*). Explain how the product/photography is made etc.

**5. Discover-ability:**

(BEYOND followers) Use *hashtags* and *location tags* in IG stories. 

(WITHIN followers) More visibility in the Instagram algorithm for those accounts with inactive followers.

**6. Story Highlights:**

Create multiple *highlights* to emphasize each account's *BRAND*. The general feed serves as a portfolio for artists, designers, photographers etc. Stories are documentation of the creative process.",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1529680311,2018-06-22 15:11:51,,,

115,"I realize now that it was a bit rude of me to offer unsolicited advice, so I apologize for that. I just relate to your frustration and wanted to give you my two cents.

But since we're already having a conversation I might as well elaborate and offer some counter points:  


&gt; Really the only people that I'd unfollow are the people that followed me  that I almost felt obligated to follow back (especially if I didn't  actually like their art). So yes I'll probably go through and try to  find people whose art I don't actually like and remove them.

Yeah, definitely do that. You are in no way obligated to follow someone back, **especially** if you **don't even like their art**. Friends and family is of course a more socially complicated matter.  


&gt; Regardless, I could easily say the same sentiment in reverse--and I'd  expect a lot of people would look at this way over what you say. For  example, I can't tell you how many people I chose not to follow because  they barely follow anyone. That looks so scummy to me (and I'm sure  many). It's like they think they are the best in the world and no artist  could possibly be better than them, or atleast an inspiration to them.  

Yeah, usually opposing extremes are rarely desirable, that's why people value balance.  


&gt; If anything I'd expect many to view it positively that I follow so many  other artists... I do so because I like their art, which is the purpose  of the platform. 

I've learned that *expecting* anything of instagram usually leads to disappointment. Look, I totally understand your sentiment here, I too want to be as supportive as I possibly can towards my fellow artists. That's why I have to ask you, do you REALLY like the art of the people you follow, as in, do you *like* or otherwise *engage* with the posts of *every single account* you follow? Because I don't think that's something you can realistically do when following nearly 2000 people.

The way instagram's algorithm works these days is that whenever you open the app, it will show you the most relevant posts that it *thinks* you want to see, based on your overall activity. In your case, I imagine the algo probably prefers to show you content from the biggest accounts you follow, since it already knows it's quality content. It will probably also show content from people you're close with. But because you follow so many accounts, instagram has to prioritize, which means there are probably loads of people who's content you'll never see in your feed, usually smaller accounts that you might actually want to support, but can't since you never see their posts. What's bad about this is that in this way, you can be someone's ghost follower, a follower that never engages with their content. A few ghost followers aren't too bad, and most people have them. But when they accumulate, they bring an accounts engagement-rate down, which in turn will make instagram show their content to less people. Less people seeing their content means even less engagement, and there you have a vicious cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I think the reason that I'm not growing the way I'd like to is pretty  clear. I don't post consistently enough, I don't partake in common  artist community trends like DTIYS, and I seldom post videos of my work  (which I hear helps with the algorithm). If I did the above I'm sure I'd  start to get more followers. Getting better at art in general is also  an obvious way to get more followers. I highly doubt the number of  people I follow will hold me back in that regard.

Are they a close friend of the poster or just someone they met once at a party ten years ago? Did a hundred other people already like and share the content?)

Also, a standup show is a different type of shared collective experience - socially, sometimes merely hearing someone laugh causes a chain reaction. That emotion may not translate when written on a page, even if the live version of the joke is hilarious.

Ultimately, it comes down to understanding what types of content works well where, as well as having a variety of techniques to make sure it gets seen. Influencers often join groups that like and share each others’ content and develop relationships with other influencers to game the Instagram algorithm (also leaving less room for us “normals” to be seen).

1. **Like/comment posts of your inactive followers**. Go through or your inactive followers – like and comment on their posts. Get creative with what you write, grab their attention and engage with them. If you show that you care about your audience and that they matter, they will quickly start engaging again. Go through your follower list, find users who posted stories, and interact with their stories, questions, polls.
2. **Direct message your inactive followers**. Hit your followers up – each with a message to rebuild interest and direct them to your posts. The easiest way to get reactions is by suggesting to comment an honest opinion on your new post or even just asking for support. If you have a big audience, be sure to make different message templates/variants, so you don’t get blocked by Instagram for spamming.
3. If you want to really get attention back fast – **Go Viral**. Get your content to rank higher in your audience's home feed, by making them engage. If you do this continuously it’ll work the best for regaining reach from your own audience. (For this I just usually run ads and sometimes if the audience is large enough directly to my followers)
4. **BONUS TIP:** Improve your results by replying to comments under your posts, story replies, and using questions to carry the conversation.
5. **Post an image and story video saying that Instagram algorithm has changed and limited your reach**. Kindly ask people to support you by liking, commenting and saving, or even sharing. Since when you engage with an account you’re following, it makes their content rank higher in your home feed. And this is exactly what we want.

109,"Hey. I'm not a big account on instagram, but here are some tips of my own:

- **niche**. I know many of us like to make instagram a reflection of our lives, and what we like to do. But to gain a following, having photos that are a little all over the place is not going to help grow.
Think of it from a consumer view. Most people won't follow strangers just to see random content. It has to be oriented towards something. If gaming and movies are your thing, then *be consistent* about that. The occasional selfie or foodstagram are fine, but (unless you're really attractive or a food account), most people will not be interested.

- once you have your niche defined, **let other people know**. Write a decent bio. Not too short. If you're, say, a gaming channel, make sure to write that on your bio, so people know immediately what to expect.

- **photo quality**. Post your own content, and make sure the photos are good quality. Be mindful of the lighting while taking the photo and the filter you use while posting it. Many people like to keep some sort of feed consistency. Do this if you want to, but it's a lot more time-consuming.

- **plan**. If you want to grow, have some sort of posting plan. Know when your followers engage with you the most, and when you have the most exposure. Write captions that are not too short (only celebs get away with a one-word or emoji caption, hah).

- **hashtags**. Instagram allows up to 30 hashtags. Some people have said that 3-5 # is what boosts accounts the most, but I found that my photos are more popular when I post 20-30 tags in the caption (not the comment). Figure out what works for you.

- **instastories**. A great way to interact closely with followers. Use polls, that slider thing, ask a question and tell your followers to DM you the answer, etc.

- **live**. When you go live, your followers get a notification, so they can tune in. If you're a gamer, why not livestream something quick on instagram? Maybe tell your followers in your stories that you'll be going live at 8pm that day? Idk, depends on how engaged your following is.

- **engagement**. There's two parts to this, as I see it.
1) engage with people you follow/mutuals. On the daily, man. The instagram algorithm shows you the accounts you interact with the most. If you comment on other people's accounts, chances are they'll reply to your comment and leave comments on your photos as well, making your account more likely to appear on their feed; and 2) interacting with accounts using hashtags. Search for a specific hashtag, and like/comment (in a genuine, non-spammy way) on the photos. Follow some people if you like. You'll see your engagement go up.

- there are also **engagement groups**. Basically a groupchat on instagram where everyone shares their new photo and the rest like and comment on it. I don't recommend it because it's a big hassle, but if you're interested, maybe give /r/IgPods a visit?


Also, don't be afraid to engage first! It's okay if some accounts don't reply, but taking that step will help you break the ice with a lot of like-minded people!

Posting at the time that most of your audience is online is indeed a best practice. For example, Hootsuit claims that globally the best time to post is Wednesday at 11:00 a.m.

Obviously it doesn't mean anything about your audience which might be active in different hours, but more importantly posting in the right hour doesn't mean that your post is going to get a lot of exposure.

The quality of the content as much more impact on how viral your post is going to get compared to at which hour did you post.

When you post something new, the Instagram algorithm exposes it to see how much interaction it gets with your audience. If they won't interact with it then other posts with more engagement will hit their feeds and explore pages.

One of the videos I like to share on that topic is the one by [Alec Wilcock](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialgrowthhackers/comments/qe069p/guide_not_getting_enough_reach_find_what_content/) where he looks into the most viral content of his competitors in order to learn from it and optimize his content.

But it's not only content optimization, other growth tactics are required as well. Here's a quick tip that could help, and I suggest to do it manually unless you have vast experience with blackhat techniques: 

Find too successful accounts in the niche and once per day look into their latest posts, enter the list of likes or comments, enter the profiles of these users and comment on their posts.

Don't make it promotional and don't ask them to follow you, just give them a contextual comment and they will organically check you out.

This is just what I’m observing so it may not be correct but I’m pretty sure it’s close to the truth: Right now I think what’s most helpful for artists who want a greater audience are to participate in dtiys challenges and get reshares. If you’re not getting involved, it’s tough to get attention as opposed to the artists who are taking advantage of those 2 things. When your art gets liked, commented on, reshared, and/or saved, it shows the IG algorithm that your art is enjoyed by others and it will prioritize your post more on people’s feeds (which helps if your posts are otherwise getting buried). When ppl view but don’t interact with your posts, that tells the IG algorithm that those ppl are not interested in your content and will thus show your posts lower in people’s feed / not at all. So if you want more people to see your posts, you need to focus on both quality and quantity, and try to reach an audience who you think will appreciate your art and actually interact with it.

Here are the things I see that could use improvement:

Your engagement rate could use a look at. I think you should take a scroll through your followers and see what kind of demo your attracting and if that is the demo you want. The current instagram algorithm favours a quick and good engagement rate otherwise your post will be buried in your followers feeds. You might want to look through them and remove any inactive accounts, bot accounts and large company accounts that never engage with your work. 

Engagement goes both ways; you should respond to all the comments that you get. Plus engaging with the content you follow; from what I have seen, but have no measured proof of this anywhere, following a **ton** of people isn't helpful because then you can never engage with a good percentage of the content you follow. 

Last thing; you can be posting more often with more consistent content. At the moment your feed is a bit messy; there's a new colour palette, new background and new lighting in every photo.

I’m not familiar with every platform, but I worked in a marketing department between 2013-2015 running an Instagram account, and it was way easier then, didn’t have to use any money for posts. So in terms of Instagram, the hardest thing is getting your posts noticed or acknowledged AT ALL. 

You have to keep in mind that the Instagram Algorithm factors in not just how you currently run your account, but ALL past interactions, so this means your first post onward. I have a lot of friends and acquaintances who just don’t use social media anymore, and have been slowly doing so since like 2017. It sucks to think that Instagram is factoring this in. I’d say about a fourth of my users only use Instagram to browse stories. So already, that’s factoring in how each and every post I make gets processed. 
    
The whole “you need to make super impactful content” thing is also somewhat loony too. I follow accounts who create great content, content that’s consistent and you can tell time was put into it. There’s a story, there’s emotion. But they have way less followers than me, and their growth has been stagnant over the years. The “emotional impact thing” only works for established brands, like “actually has a working, consistent business, possibly has a store or office” type of brands or people who just have a strong following in general. I’m not saying you shouldn’t do this with your content or that emotional stories don’t work, but the idea that “this is what your brand needs” is rhetoric that a lot of influencers and social media companies are trying to use to cover up the fact that the algorithm has just become a labyrinth for most Instagram users. 
    
Tiktok has been a completely different story In terms of growth and reach. I started an Instagram for a new thing I’m doing, and then started a Tiktok for it on Oct. 12th. That siecidyc Instagram has only 3 followers and I’m lucky if I get more than 2 likes on a post, if any. My tiktok has gained 530 followers since Oct. 12th and I have a few videos that have several thousand views, one that has 140k views, over 3000 likes and 36 comments. While this isn’t much in terms of social media, I’ve seen more growth and interaction on my tiktok in a month than I’ve seen on my main Instagram account (3900 followers) AND I barely post on Tiktok.

One of the biggest things I figured out with the Instagram algorithm is that it uses a rotation system on how it suggests you're account to follow to other accounts within your niche category !  


The bread and butter of the follow system is the suggested accounts to follow, for example if I follow a travel photography Instagram account the algorithm will suggest other travel photography Instagram accounts to follow.  


The problem now you face is your account is now down ranked and deboosted from the suggested accounts to follow category within your niche since the rotation system restarted on the 10/10/2019  


Here is your account look what happened to your account after 10/10/2019

On top of the non-chronological feed (algorithm) not exactly working in my favor, pictures in my classroom typically get the most likes but I think it's highly unethical to use my public school classroom as a backdrop for paid sponsorships.

Doing a little meme challenge is a fun way to engage my followers with posts that didn't reach many people the first time and to also provide them with something free that they like to see in return :) Hope that helped answer your question!

Since I’m a professional illustrator, I have to consider it part of my job to continue updating my IG as it can attract more of my target audience than Twitter or especially Tumblr. However, fluctuations in algorithm and engagement can be really disheartening.

BTW- I used to only update only once a month and it took 2 years to get 3,000 followers. However, since moving to consistent and frequent uploading, I’ve gained another 6,500 followers in 4 months and am nearly at the 10,000 mark. I also host weekly IG live painting sessions, and I think that may make the algorithm treat me even better.

Also, being really consistent in style and content encourages more followers.

As you say, the change of the Instagram algorithm has impacted a lot of things. We've seen a general drop in terms of likes, comments and gained followers for everybody, including our own Instagram account @iconosquare.

This drop of engagement came as Instagram does not sort the media in a chronological order in your feed anymore. 

Of course, if you do Instagram ads, you ""won't"" have this problem anymore. It was all planned. 

We've seen many businesses being ""more"" creative: 
- Working with micro-influencers
- Featuring User Generated Content
- Hosting contests with interesting prices

These are some of the creative new methods that business have been testing since, for most of them it has worked (it also depends on your type of business, your type of content and if you are willing to make changes in your digital strategy in order to stay ""ahead"" of the wave).

The change of the Instagram algorithm for our business was complicated, as everybody was as surprised as we were.

As the other Redditor said, these hashtag pages are personalized - so not everyone sees the same posts up in there.

Getting into the Top posts is the whole ""name of the game"" of hashtag usage for anyone looking to grow their Instagram account.

I've written a free eBook that tells you exactly what steps you have to take in order to get in there and grow your account, but I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to share here.

Just **PM me, if you're interested** in this.

How long a post stays in the Top posts depends on a variety of factors, such as how popular is the hashtag, how strong is the competition, how relevant is the content, how much engagement is the post receiving, etc.

Only on very ""unpopular"" hashtag pages, meaning low total number of posts in that hashtag, would a post stay in the Top posts for weeks.

I've had many posts do that.

80,"I'd like to thank the community by sharing a FREE guide on **how you can grow your Instagram account starting from zero as quickly as possible**.

All you need are a few proven growth strategies and you stand a realistic shot of building yourself a rock-solid following that loves and trusts you and your business/brand.

I've grown my Instagram account from 500 to over 105K real followers in less than a year, and now I want to help you guys reach that important milestone of your first 1K followers as quickly as possible, because the first 1,000 are the hardest to get and growth really starts to accelerate after that!

I've discovered that small accounts (&lt;1K followers) and big accounts (&gt;1K followers) aren't served equally well by the same growth strategies.

That's because big accounts can rely on ""word of mouth"" of their followers and the Instagram algorithm to grow their accounts (also known as ""organic growth methods"")... BUT small accounts simply can't do this, because you literally don't have a follower base to help you get your posts out there.

In other words, you need a different set of growth methods below 1K followers.

These are called ""linear growth methods"", and they work quite differently from the organic growth methods big accounts use.

Long story short, I've written a comprehensive guide showing you exactly how to implement these linear growth methods, which can get you from 0 to 1K in a matter of weeks, saving you months - if not YEARS - of painful trial and error and low-performing results.

You can read the full guide for **FREE** here:

[From 0 To 1K+ Followers ASAP](https://instagramgrowthguide.com/from-0-to-1k-followers-asap/)

In short, here's what you'll learn from this free guide in great detail:

* Profile Optimization to increase traffic to your account &amp; convert the maximum number of profile visitors to followers
* 15 powerful linear growth methods to grow your account to 1K+ followers as quickly as possible &amp; save the most amount of time and effort (works up to \~5K followers after which I advise switching to organic growth methods)
* Beginner Hashtag Strategy to drastically increase the impressions your ""small account"" gets from hashtags (and as a result increase the followers you get)
* 5 DON'Ts you definitely MUST avoid in order to stop killing your growth (these are dreadful mistakes I see Instagram ""newbies"" make time and again, and they really hurt your account)
* On top of that it even comes with an extremely helpful &amp; pimped-out Google spreadsheet that helps you with niche research, hashtag research, allows you to track &amp; analyze your account growth &amp; performance, and much more.

You should find it quite helpful, if you're below 1K followers right now and even if you have more than that, I'm sure you'll still stumble upon some highly useful nuggets such as Instagram SEO secrets that are included in this free guide.

I follow a lot other photogs. Some of the more successful ones have really grown their accounts from a few K to 10-20k+ in the past year or so. So it is possible. But you either have to (1) have really standout content to the point where the individual images are good enough to go viral on their own, make people go WOW, (2) live on IG and work your audience and have a solid base of fans/friends, (3) have pictures that do well shrunk down to IG size and format.  


Also keep in mind that the photogs that are growing are doing so at the expense of everyone else. When IG recommends your account / picture in explore that means you are kicking somebody else out of a recommendation.

67,"I could give you more personalised feedback if I knew what your account was. There's probably a bunch of basic things I'd suggest you do around how/what/when/where you post, hashtag usage, caption structure, etc. And also how to tie that back into an overall strategy for your IG page, because that will differ depending on whether you're a professional food photographer vs a food blogger vs a food meme account, etc.

Aside from that, my general strategy is always to engage with engagers:

* Instead of commenting/liking posts on accounts similar to yours, look at the people commenting/liking those posts, and go comment/like their posts. Most people's personal instagram accounts get very few genuine comments/likes, so they'll pay more attention to the legitimate ones they get.

* Engage with the people who already follow you. This will bump account your engagement rate

* Engage with the people who already like/comment on your posts. Especially old posts. Re-engage that audience from 12 months ago. You want the Instagram algorithm to go ""Hey, this guy really likes photos by anotherhello, I'm going to make sure we put those at the top of their feed""

* Reply to every comment you receive (except the spammier ones, which I recommend you delete/report)

What will end up happening is you'll gather followers whose default behaviour is high-engagement. This, in turn, will lead to your account naturally getting more engagement from those people, which will in turn bump you in all of instagram's discovery algorithms (Suggested accounts, top posts in the hashtags you use, top of follower's feed), which will organically generate more followers.

When your photos are consistently getting to the top of #foodie and #foodporn, your account is going to grow.

67,"When I first began I would have several accounts, one for each genre.

At first I wanted my feed really need, rows with themes, and color schemes matching, but A) it's also a pain in the ass to manage. If you want neat rows you have to post 3 pictures within the same theme or color scheme at the same time or when people visit your profile it will be a mess. And posting 3 people at the same time it's a pain in the ass for your followers and thus a shot in the foot regarding Instagram's algorithm. And most important, B) since it constrains you and it makes harder to post, you might find yourself posting once every two weeks or every two months like it happened to me sometimes. So the ""mess"" on your feed it's kind of freeing. As someone who loves a well crafted feed, and has OCD, I still prefer the freedom that a ""messy"" Instagram feed provides.

Follow/ unfollow isn't necessarily my favorite method either, but I do use it to speed things up. I don't rely on it completely, as I use many other preferable methods to growing my following.

Dynamic hashtags: When I started my account a year ago, I posted with the 30 most popular hashtags in my niche. But the hashtags really were ineffective. There is no way someone with 20 likes per post can get into the top nine of a hashtag with +1 million posts in it. Post niched hashtags that are less popular, and dominate them in the top nine. The audience size is smaller on these hashtags, but it is much better than getting drowned out in .5 seconds in a popular hashtag.

Liking other people's posts: I also like a few hundred posts a day of non-followers that are interested in my niche. Oftentimes, they see I liked their post, they visit my page, and if they like what they see, they can choose to follow. 

Major Key: ""they can choose to follow if they like what they see."" Ultimately, people will choose to follow you if you post great content and on a consistent basis. Provide value through your posts- whether it be humour or informational content, post content that provides value to your followers.

Balance: If you're selling something, anything- be it affiliate products or your own products- maintain a good balance between value posts and promotional posts. 80% of your posts should be pure value, 20% should be promotional or calls to action. Instagram is a social platform where people do not like to feel sold to. Focus on building a community of engaged users, and they will buy from you because of the value you provide. 

Keep a good engagement rate: Instagram's algorithm is now all engagement based. If you have a lot of followers, but only 1/20 of those followers actually like or comment on your posts, that shows Instagram's algorithm that since 19/20 people that follow you do not like your posts, you must make some shitty content. In turn, the algorithm limits your organic discoverability. To resolve this issue, I always remove all of my ghost followers as they are deadweight when trying to grow an Instagram following. To do follow/ unfollow, liking, and removing ghost followers, I just use EngagementGenie.com as that all takes too much time manually to do myself. I focus on posting quality, original content 2-3 times daily, and constantly doing new, in-depth hashtag research to broaden my reach.

So I can't take the average person on here who is not connected with Instagram as a 100% honest with their help or information... because quite simple nobody knows how the algorithm system works on Instagram only the people who work for Instagram ! 


So people on here who say they know how the algorithm on Instagram works might be spreading conspiracy theories  ..you seen all the YouTube click bait videos how to hack the Instagram algorithm system and get more engagements....that's all nonsense is it not ?",Instagram,"""instagram algorithm""",,1534729420,2018-08-20 1:43:40,,,
65,"Here is a breakdown for what we know about IG algorithm, now keep in mind that these are all (educated) guesses as there is no official information by IG.  
  

**1) How do you make more people see your photo on their feeds:**  

At first only a handful of users see your post, if enough of these users engage (likes + comments), it's gets shown to more people (and if enough engage, more and more)... Keep in mind that if someone out of the blue comes to your profile and likes your stuff, it doesn't count..  

**2) What defines the order in which posts are shown in your timeline:**  

a) Recently followed accounts always have priority, this is why you usually see always 1 or 2 posts of somebody you've just followed.  
b) Engagement (the more a user engages with your posts, the higher the priority)  
...   

If a ""bad post"" curses your account? Not that we know, but there is a ripple effect here (ie: you post something I don't like, I don't engage with the post, your priority will be lower next time for my timeline).  
You should one of these days post something and leave it as is (ie: don't engage with other accounts, don't like/comment on the stuff on your timeline) to see by itself how many of your followers will engage on your content naturally.  
...  

But since you post so sparingly it's hard to know for sure what is ""wrong"", you may've posted in days of lower online users, people who followed you because of bikini pictures may not enjoy trekking photos, people who likes music may not like a picture of your mother. It's hard to pinpoint.",Instagram,"""ig algorithm""",,1526594569,2018-05-17 22:02:49,,,
65,"Hello, I just saw your page, and I think you are doing great so far considering your account is only a couple of months old! I like that your page has a consistent theme- the black and white drawing in the same notebook with the gray wood, it’s very well done. You could add the educational content pillar to your page. For example, post a picture of weed plants and add the health benefits in the caption to try to break the stigma associated with marijuana. 

I did a little experiment and found that when I post quality content at least once per day, I gain at least 500 more followers monthly than if I posted less frequently. Providing quality content consistently makes people constantly active on your account. 

When I started my account a year ago, I posted with the 30 most popular hashtags in my niche- as I see you seem to be doing as well. But I realized using the most popular hashtags was ineffective. There is no way someone with 20 likes per post can get into the top nine of a hashtag with +1 million posts in it. To resolve this issue, I now post niched hashtags that are less popular (below 500k posts) and dominate these semi-popular hashtags in the top nine. The audience size is smaller on these hashtags, but it is much better than getting drowned out in .5 seconds in a popular hashtag.

I also like a few hundred posts a day of non-followers that are interested in my niche. Additionally, I follow several hundred like-minded people daily. When they see I liked their post or followed them, they visit my page, and if they like what they see, they can choose to follow. The key here is that ""they can choose to follow if they like what they see."" Ultimately, people will choose to follow you if you provide value to them by posting great content and on a consistent basis.

Additionally, Instagram's algorithm is now all engagement based. If you have a lot of followers, but only 1/20 of those followers actually like or comment on your posts, that shows Instagram's algorithm that since 19/20 people that follow you do not like your posts, you must make some shitty content. In turn, the algorithm limits your organic discoverability. 

To resolve this issue, I always remove all of my ghost followers as they are deadweight when trying to grow an Instagram following. The service I use to do follow/ unfollow, liking, and removing ghost followers is [EngagementGenie.](https://EngagementGenie.com) I tried to do it all manually, but it took up way too much of my time. I focus on posting quality, original content 2-3 times daily, and constantly doing new, in-depth hashtag research to broaden my reach. Without making good content, follow/ unfollow and liking are both pointless to me since no one will want to follow anyway. I hope this helps!

64,"This is the strategy that has worked the best for me:

I use 10 less popular hashtags (meaning these hashtags have less than 100k total posts). The competition from these less popular hashtags is lower, so I am more likely to reach the top nine in them. Next, I use 10 hashtags that are in my niche and have +100k-500k posts. Reaching the top nine in a few of the ten less popular hashtags helps me reach the top nine in +100-500k hashtags. And last, I use ten hashtags with over 500 k posts to reach a large audience. 

Instagram's algorithm is all based on engagement now. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate. That shows Instagram that you make good content that your followers value, so Instagram’s algorithm will not only put you at the top of your followers’ feeds but will also make you more visible for new followers on both the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. So naturally, to keep a great engagement rate, I make sure to constantly remove ghost followers that drag down my engagement rate. To manage my engagement rate, I use engagementgenie.com. In combination with using that online service and doing the dynamic hashtag technique I mentioned, I once doubled my active follower count when I got into the top nine on a hashtag with 1.1 million.

I had the same problem as you, I wasn’t getting enough likes and comments relative to my number of followers. I focused on growing my number of followers when Instagram’s algorithm is based on engagement. 

A good engagement rate (15-30%) shows Instagram's algorithm that your followers like your content- since they are actively liking and commenting on your posts. A bad engagement rate (less than 10%) shows the algorithm that your content must be low-quality since your followers don’t like it. Instagram will increase your organic discoverability through the explore page and hashtags if you have a good engagement rate. 

Even with making quality content consistently as you are doing, I had barely a 3% engagement rate with 20k followers, so I was getting above 600 but less than 1k likes per post. To increase my engagement rate and organic discoverability, I had my ghost followers (inactive accounts or active accounts that don’t like my posts) removed.

Successful accounts have no problem achieving this.

If it doesn’t get liked early on, the vast majority of your followers aren’t even seeing it. If you’re an artist who’s on Instagram for either exposure or sales, likes still matter a ton—Instagram hiding them does nothing to change that.

57,"Shadowban doesn’t exist.. If your posts ‘don’t appear in hashtags’, and the type of post isn’t flagged (not your account, the post itself), it’s because those accounts behaviours don’t dictate they typically like your posts, or what you post. It doesn’t mean the post isn’t there, nor does it imply a ‘shadowban’. 

I think people need a basic understanding of facebook marketing (the basis of the IG ‘algorithm’) before they assume ‘shadowban’. Whoever first coined that phrase has created a wave of false info. 

As for lack of engagement from hashtags, again not a shadowban - insta/facebook have been going after bot related services since november last year (when they sued 2 big ones in new zealand). There was another major wave between May and July that severely damaged automated and bot services, and the millions of accounts loaded into those services have struggled to regain access, some have just quit altogether, some have to reload those profiles in blah blah. In that meantime, the actions those accounts perform have been severely limited if not blocked altogether.

Those services, were the ones engaging with posts via hashtags (and the plethora of other ways they did engage). You never needed to have paid for them or be apart of them etc, they just did them anyway. So the engagement you’ve lost, be followers or likes etc, aren’t from legitimate sources, or are fake profiles altogether anyway. In short - that engagement you’ve lost is fake anyway. What’s left is what you ACTUALLY get. Now I know people might find that confronting, but thats just how it is. But, its an opportunity to grow where others now wont. 

oh and as mentioned, it has nothing to do with mental health, and everything to do with protecting the value of its data. The inauthetic botted data, is worthless. Cant sell advertising with worthless data. So stomping on automated and inauthentic behavior on the platform is the solution.

56,"very sorry man, here is the article in full, as said I'm new to reddit. 

Instagram has over 400 million DAILY active users.
35% of users look at it more than twice per day.
Instagram has generated $1.53 BILLION in Ad revenue in 2016 alone and 50% of users follow at LEAST one business.
And yet, people are underestimating and killing their Instagram on a daily basis.
So, I decided to create a guide and explain how to do it like a pro!
Step 1: BUY FAKE LIKES!
This is a trending practice lately and for those of you that don’t know what this actually means. It simply means that you actually pay somebody to send likes to your pictures.
You would need to find a Market for this and “Telegram Market Groups” are the best.
Once you find the right Market Group you only have to ask and you can buy what you have been looking for, and it’s easy!

You are very close to KILLING your account this way!
Some users buy likes and followers to exploit the “Bandwagon Effect”. They think that the profile will be more appealing given the higher numbers, but they are wrong.
They are simply killing their account.
Why?
Because Instagram’s algorithm focuses on engagement.
It can tell where it’s coming from, and that is the key factor.
Fake likes will not put your pictures on the Explore Page.
Thus if you buy likes from profiles that won’t engage with your feed properly, you are actually killing it!
STEP 2: BUY FAKE FOLLOWERS!
Some people also buy fake followers for their account to have the same “Bandwagon effect”!
This time they try to catch the user’s attention by showing a lot of followers, but you know what?
They are killing their account!
The reason is that those followers are fake!
They are not active and even if those profiles exist, they are not following the account for the content nor for the brand!
So they will not engage.
I understand that being at 5'000 followers with 400 likes per post might be frustrating.
You see bigger profiles in your niche having better results and you want to reach them, but FAKE engagement will not help.
400 likes on a 5000 profile is actually an awesome result!
Assuming those are organic you will have a few comments as well and so your engagement rate should be above 8%.
8% REAL engagement is a very good result!
If you actually buy 50'000 followers though, your engagement rate will drop to below 1%.
Why?
Because they will never interact so you will have 55'000 followers, and 400 likes!
This tells Instagram that people don’t engage with your account and the likelihood of you hitting the “Explore page” will be much lower!
This will make it much easier to kill your account!
STEP 3: AUTOMATIC POSTING!
Here we come to the last step that you need to take in order to kill your Instagram profile!
Use an app to post on your behalf!
I don’t mean apps like Hootsuite but apps that will post your image without requiring any action from you!
This is something that will really piss off the Instagram Algorithm.
Instagram wants his users to USE the app!
It wants them to stay within Instagram at all times in fact if you open a link on Instagram it will load within the app.
If you use a “scheduling app” to post on your behalf, Instagram will know it. First because the IP address you are posting from will be from an IP pool used from the app. 
Second of all, because to do so you need to use the Private API and therefore the Instagram “O auth”.
Instagram will know this and flag your account.
That will lower your engagement level for the week and thus help to kill your account!
BONUS: There is one more thing left to do if you are ready to kill your Instagram account like a PRO!
This is a practice that few people know is bad.
So even people that are trying to succeed and generate revenue from Instagram might be doing it.
So, pay attention!
To kill your Instagram account, on top of buying likes, followers, and auto-posting, you should DELETE a few posts and comments.
The more you delete the worse your account engagement will get and the harder it will be to recover it!
Not bad, huh?
This complete guide will get you from 5'000 organic likes per post to around 100 organic likes and it is proven to work!
Now let me, also explain fully why that is, and the exact steps you need to “AVOID” if you want to kill your account.
Those steps will only drive engagement UP and will make you go viral and gain followers!
But first we need to go a bit more technical:
The Instagram Algorithm tracks Your actions to categorise your account.
It will track actions such as:
Posts You comment on
Posts You look at
Posts You like
Users that like Your posts
Users that comment Your posts
Users You follow
Users that follows You
Content You post
Captions You use
Hashtags You use
Mentions
They use all this information in order to categorise your account and put you into a certain niche box, in each niche box there are 2 types of accounts:
Instagram Users
Instagram Influencers
These 2 types of accounts are into the same niche box if they have the same interest.
So if you’re a luxury Influencer you want to be in the luxury niche box. This way you will be able to show your content to an audience that likes luxury content.
So what you DO NOT WANT to be doing if you’re an influencer and your aim is to KILL your account:
Like, Comment &amp; view content within your niche
Follow other BIGGER influencers in your niche
Post content related to your niche
Use competitive hashtags related to your niche
You can find competitive Hashtags by following this steps:
Find out how many likes you receive on average in the first 2 hours of posting (“2hAVG”)
Find hashtags which top 9 Post have an average of likes (excluding videos) equal or lower to Your “2hAVG”
This has to be AVOIDED IF YOU WANT TO KILL YOUR ACCOUNT!
Because if you do this right Instagram will categorise your account in the niche box you want, so:
You will be more likely to increase engagement
You will be more likely to gain followers
it will be harder to kill your account!
Another thing you need to avoid is to go on the “Explore page”.
For many people is hard to get there anyway but I will explain how to do it so you can make sure that you don’t and you can kill your Instagram account freely.
To hit the explore page and reach your targeted audience there’s a few things you want to do:
Get influencers in your niche to engage with your content!
Here is an example:
If you have an account and you get liked by another account in the same niche your post will appear in the Explore Page of the Active Followers
However if the account likes 1'000 post per day those 20'000 people only see a small fraction of them because
Thus you want to get as many accounts in your niche to engage with your content as possible.
So your content shows up on the Explore Page of as many people in that niche as possible.
Make sure you post viral content
To make sure what type of content is viral here’s a very simple formula:
Find a page in your niche that’s already performing really good and is able to rank on the top9 of the major hashtags in your niche.
Calculate the average likes of their recent 20 posts excluding the most recent one, so for example:
if 20 posts got a total of 94,547 likes you do: 94'547 likes/24 posts = 4'727 likes on average, now you multiply that by a 1,3 factor so:
4'727 x 1,30 = 6'145 likes!
That is the “viral level” for that account.
Find all pictures over the viral level on that page, because your targeted audience already showed interest in that piece of content which gives you a higher chance of going viral!


Example of Viral Content performance on pages below 100'000 followers.
So that is exactly the type of content you want to avoid if you want to kill your Instagram account!
We have outlined above the DOs and DON’Ts to properly kill your account.
I hope to have helped you figure out a thing or two about Instagram in the mean time and to have brightened your day with a bit of educational humour!

Personally, what I think happens is more and more followers stop using the app, become ghost followers (etc), eventually they start to pile up on each other yet the account continue to grow, slower and slower. Over time more and more followers become ghosts. The IG algorithm works by &amp;#37; of engagement based on how many people follow you./reach the post. The lower the engagement the less likely the post is to reach new followers on the app, eventually killing it. As well, their damn algorithm changes constantly fuck things up for people making this effect happen faster and faster. ",Instagram,"""ig algorithm""",,1529446913,2018-06-19 22:21:53,,,
55,"No problem! For me, there are three main keys that have helped me make my living on Instagram: 

1) Real Engagement. I try my best to reply to all of the meaningful comments people leave under my posts to encourage discussion and create a community of engaged users. I also use an engagement service with accounts of varying sizes that like each others posts to increase engagement rate. 

2) Strategic Hashtag Strategy: I used to post 30 of the most popular hashtags until I realized that the competition in popular hashtags is so high I got drowned out in .5 seconds. I use 10 less popular hashtags in my niche (meaning these hashtags have less than 100k total posts). The competition from these less popular hashtags is lower, so I am more likely to reach the top nine in them. Next, I use 10 hashtags that are in my niche and have +100k - 500k posts. Reaching the top nine in a few of the ten less popular hashtags helps me reach the top nine in +100 - 500k hashtags. And last, I use ten hashtags with over 500k posts to reach a large audience.

3) Only Grow with an Active Following: Instagram's algorithm is engagement based. Meaning if you haven't built that community and many of your followers do not like or comment on any of your posts, you have a disengaged following. The algorithm will limit your organic discoverability if you have a lot of these ""ghost followers."" Posting quality content consistently will help keep your followers active. For those that remain ghosts, remove them by blocking and unblocking. Ghost followers are deadweight when trying to grow an active community of engaged Instagram users. Having a ""clean"" following of people that actively like &amp; comment on your posts will make Instagram's algorithm promote your content through the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. 

TL;DR: Engage, use hashtags strategically, Remove ghost followers, post quality content consistently",Entrepreneur,"""Instagram's algorithm""",,1516484940,2018-01-20 21:49:00,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking

To add on, the post is given an hour testing period to see what percentage of the followers that saw the post actually liked the post. This determines if Instagram will put your post in your followers feeds. This is why having ghost followers is detrimental to account growth- ghost followers will never like or comment when your post shows up in their feed- limiting your visibility in Insta's engagement-based algorithm.

52,"Absolutely, 

First Instagram is all about engagement. All social medias are engagement based. 

Example, Youtube you get a lot of likes and views and you go on trending.

same with facebook. You get a lot of likes, shares, comments you are going viral.

Same thing with Instagram. You get a lot of shares, views, likes and comments and you can go viral. 

The way Instagram works right now is that Frequency, Following and Usage. 

• **Frequency:** How often you open Instagram, as it will try to show you the best posts since your last visit.

• **Following:** If you follow a lot of people, Instagram will be picking from a wider breadth of authors so you might see less of any specific person.

• **Usage:** How long you spend on Instagram determines if you’re just seeing the best posts during short sessions, or it’s digging deeper into its catalog if you spend more total time browsing.

With that said,  people’s feeds are tuned based on what kind of content they engage with, so if you never stop to watch videos you might see fewer of them.

This is why is so important for people to engage with your content. If you haven't notice the people that haven't like or comment your picture in a while they are more likely to not see your pictures frequently because either they don't spend a lot of time on IG or they are not engaging with your content. NOW, lets say they engage with your content. They are more likely to see it more frequently. Raising your stories views,  and more likes on images because they are engaging with your content. The algorithm says you like this content I will give you more of that!

46,"&gt; I kind of treat Instagram hashtags like i would forum topics, eventually people get to know each other, people recognize you, and reciprocate.

That's a really interesting idea. I guess particularly if you're commenting on the content that your followers are looking at, your comments bubble to the top for followers now don't they? And if you're sourcing your followers from the hasthags you're commenting on (is likely to happen organically), there's a good chance you'll get to be known sooner.

I've run a few, but the main one I grew up was @YahtzeeDog, which was about 15k before I stopped posting ~2 years ago. The method I used back then was to manually follow accounts that were actively liking posts on the hashtags I was posting on, and then to unfollow non-followers using one of the unfollowing apps - this way if an account followed you back, you'd have a higher number of followers whose default behaviour is to like posts.

It was a coincidence that all the unfollower apps got nuked by IG about the time I stopped growing that account - and then I believe not too long after the algorithm changed to penalise accounts that did massive follow/unfollow activities anyway - it certainly wouldn't be an approach I'd use in 2018.

But, I always sort of figured that if you followed the same approach but targeted commenters, that you'd end up with followers whose default behaviour is to comment - and towards the end of my playing with that account, I started looking at that as an idea.

I think if I were going to do it again in 2018, I'd heavily focus on engaging with other accounts. That $1.80 strategy Vaynerchuk recommends (give your 2 cents on the top 9 posts in 10 hashtags) is basically what I was formulating towards the end, and I think it's pretty solid - but again, I'd tweak it by focusing on engaging with engagers, specifically around commenters, and not just on top posts.

&gt;ESPECIALLY after the Instagram algorithm change earlier this year.

What was the main change at the start of 2018?

45,"I'll just address the middle point because it's where I think we lose each other? Maybe?

We are both addressing the issue of where images appear on the feed. We acknowledge there's a method or logic in which they're shown. However, (correct me if I'm wrong) I think you are saying you thought they appeared in an order based on likes so you tested this out and that's not true?

What I'm saying is I think it's still true, seeing as I pay attention to what pops up in my feed. But I think where we disconnect is I already assumed it wasn't just as simple as likes. Because if you like a post more, and Instagram's algorithm places it earlier on then it would literally filter out so much content to the point that the app is boring. I'm saying there is a level of variability but I also think their algorithm in terms of feed order is based on a complex series of tasks.

Things their algorithm probably takes into account:

1) How often you frequent that profile - if you actually go look at their profile Instagram tracks this. It also used to track this for hashtags. If you looked at a certain hashtag it would appear in your explore feed. Since they've added the ""based on likes"" subtitle it's a lot easier to see this.

2) How recently you followed that profile - Instagram wants to show you your new follows because it needs to determine how important they are. If you haven't liked someone's photos before and start following them the algorithm in theory should place them at the bottom of whatever variable determines how important a user is to another. Therefore you'd never see their posts, but by showing them early on right after following it gives you a chance to see their content.

3) I think there's a web that connects a users feed based on interaction with users, the content they follow as well as the content that those ""third degree"" users engage with. I have no proof for this but I've observed moments where similar feeds appear, so sometimes I'll have a hot streak of food, or tattoos but what's interesting is all of those food bloggers also interact with one another on some level. Instagram probably says ""hey Matthew (that's me) follows thefeedfeed lets show him a symmetrybreakfast post as well.""

4) Its entirely possible to code randomness into the equation. It's code, the possibilities are endless. Seeing as Instagram is under Facebook's control I would say that at minimum they use pseudo-random filtering at some point on the feed, but it's possible to have random filtering too.

Ultimately you're always gonna be ""wrong"" even if you're right unless you sit down with a programmer for Instagram (maybe a comp sci scholar?) and actually get them to explain the algorithm.",Instagram,"""Instagram's algorithm""",,1488971663,2017-03-08 11:14:23,sensemaking,sensemaking,Explain

44,"If you have a decent follower count, but don't post very often, it's highly likely that the Instagram algorithm is causing your pieces to not get very much attention. 

  Being inconsistent causes your posts to get posted to a lower percentage of people that follow you and if those people happen to be low quality followers (ie, just flat out don't interact with your posts), those people won't interact with your post. The less people that interact with your post within the first hour it's on Instagram, the lower ""quality"" Instagram determines the content to be. That doesn't mean your art is low quality, just that Instagram's algorithm considers the post to be something people don't want to see. I would assume the 4 likes you got are from close friends/followers that consistently like everything of yours. 

  The only way to get more and more eyes on your posts is to post on a consistent basis. Instagram is less about getting one extremely high quality piece of content out every few weeks and more about marketing. If you want to grow your art page, you have to follow the same tactics that a business would follow to grow their following.

  My recommendation is to post small sketches daily if you can and interact with other artist's posts that put work out similar to yours, but have smaller communities (between 100-1000 followers but have a lot of interaction on their posts from those followers).

44,"So I actually wrote up a detailed post about my experience [removing 3,000 followers from Instagram](https://www.dananicoledesigns.com/ghost-followers-instagram/) and I'll explain why I did it and how it helped.

&amp;#x200B;

First, here's how Instagram's algorithm works:

 

&gt;Three main factors determine what you see in your Instagram feed:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interest:** How much Instagram predicts you’ll care about a post, with higher ranking for what matters to you, determined by past behavior on similar content and potentially machine vision analyzing the actual content of the post.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Recency:** How recently the post was shared, with prioritization for timely posts over weeks-old ones.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Relationship:** How close you are to the person who shared it, with higher ranking for people you’ve interacted with a lot in the past on Instagram, such as by commenting on their posts or being tagged together in photos.

Source:  [https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this, we can deduct that if someone isn't interacting with your content, it's not going to be shown in their feed very often. If you have a high percentage of ghost followers (i.e. people who aren't interacting with your content) the algorithm may start to take note. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, let's say you have 1,000 followers and 500 of them are ghost followers who never engage with anything you post.

&amp;#x200B;

Instagram's algorithm may begin to pick up on the fact that 50% of your followers never like or comment on anything you post. Generally speaking, content that doesn't get much interaction may be considered poor quality. Hence, your content begins to show lower and lower in people's feeds.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, is it good to remove your ghost followers?**

&amp;#x200B;

In my article I point out the while yes, it CAN be beneficial, you need to be sure that the users you are deleting are in fact people who aren't interacting with your content because they aren't your ideal follower.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask yourself the following questions:

 

1. have I done anything that would have attracted a large number of off-niche followers? (if you answer yes, you might want to consider deleting them).
2. have I purchased followers? (Buying followers is not a good idea! If you bought followers at some point, I recommend going through and deleting your bot followers).
3. have I participated in lots of “follow-for-follow” trains? (Again, follow-for-follow is going to land you a bunch of off-niche followers. If you built your following off of this strategy and your engagement is terribly low, I would recommend you consider deleting some accounts).
4. have I done my best to get targetted followers, but am still lacking engagement? (If you answered yes, then deleting your followers isn’t going to help. It sounds like you need to re-evaluate other parts of your strategy).

If you are absolutely certain that your followers have turned into ghost-followers because they are simply uninterested in your content, then deleting them can help. However, if they are ghost-followers because they just haven't seen your content in a long time (which can happen) then you might want to try interacting with them a little bit to try and build up your relationship with them, and get your content to show in their feed.

44,"I wasn't sure of your experience so I thought I would keep it simple just in case!

Since you have an idea of what you're doing:

&gt;are you saying that Facebook and Instagram ads are managed centrally and that you can use one pricing model and dashboard to monitor them both?

This is true. You monitor, create, and change ads for both Facebook and Instagram through the Facebook Ads Manager.

&gt;Also, is there a specific source for your comment that $30 gets you a reach up to 110k or is that anecdotal based on your past experience?

This I know through past experience, however it is possible to get even more. My best campaign ever yielded about 80k after $8, however the client decided to cancel the advertisement. Still not sure how that occured though.

&gt;I have past experience with Influencer marketing so I'll be putting together a plan for that

I understand you have experience with influencer marketing, but I'm not sure if you've been keeping up with the changing rates? Recently, due to the Facebook and Instagram algorithm changes, influencers on both platforms have received *massive* slaughters to their engagement rates and unique views. However the prices have actually risen. If you're willing to do it, and you know how to do it effectively, go for it; but do be aware of the recent changes.

&amp;#x200B;

For your first objective, it would probably be in your best interest to do a general campaign, monitor who your multiple impressionists are, and try and retarget them for sales. If your primary objective is brand awareness in this case, it may not be a worthwhile investment to retarget, because the CCA will thus become quite high.

I like the approach you have set up, but can I ask what central dashboard do you plan on using? I've not heard of any dashboard that can centralise multiple platforms, however I think it's a fantastic idea.

I can give you a few pointers, but since I am starting a social media marketing agency based on my findings, I'll keep it brief.

If you pay for the services, be sure to ask them if they are using an automation service - most people who claim to offer you ""organic"" followers, you automation to usual follow/unfollow method. I have it on good authority that Instagram is on to that and is going to corrupt the automated accounts. Hashtags have changed as well - the do's and don'ts list for hashtags has increased. 

I had  a potential client tell me that he needed to organically raise their followers count from 32,000 to 50,000  in four months. I told him, if someone promises you a certain amount of followers - 18k in four months, specially - That's a big red flag. 

Secondly,  if he has 32,000 LIVE followers already and seems to have reached a plateau - It's most likely that he needs a redesign of his instagram account and/or create an algorithm + aesthetically friendly formula. Also, with so many active followers he probably wasn't engaging enough.

Granted, I'm probably not favoring Instagram's algorithm because I don't post multiple times a week (and anime art is definitely oversaturated there) but it's definitely noticeable. I honestly stopped posting on IG (it's been about a month for me) because I got so stressed out with the numbers and it got to the point where it became really unhealthy for me mentally. I stopped enjoying actually sharing my art with people and focused more on the numbers/drawing stuff just to post.

I even started trying to switch up hashtags a bit and do the Draw This in Your Style Challenges that my other IG art friends hosted but it hasn't really helped either. 

From what I've seen Instagram definitely seems to favor consistency, so if you post often and a lot of the same type of thing I think you'll be seen more, generally speaking. But on top of working on your art, you also have to constantly fight with the algorithm to actually have your art be seen, which is really annoying unless you somehow get lucky and the algorithm favors one of your posts and it shows up in peoples' explore feed. This, along with the constant self promotions people comment on your posts as well as the stupid follow/unfollow tactics a lot of artists use make using Instagram a hassle.

But remember that you are not your numbers and they don't measure your success! It's very easy to fall into a toxic mindset about worrying about your likes and how many followers you get (and I've definitely been there and still do kind of worry about it), but the most important thing is your art! And it absolutely sucks when a drawing that you work on for hours gets very little attention, but good art does not equal a lot of numbers. I've seen people post literally the same type of drawings and have hundreds of likes and a bunch of followers but other skilled artists with only a couple hundred followers and less likes. At this point I think that when posting on Instagram you either need to get really lucky with a post, or learn how to game (their really shitty) algorithm to get your posts' engagement boosted.

I use an organic rounds service for myself and my clients (through my agency [electrolyte.la](https://www.electrolyte.la/)), although the network is quite elite, and it doesn't actually perform follow/unfollow/comment/etc actions for me - it does however bring me a lot of natural traffic to push posts to the 'explore' tab.

Love your brand page! Though, as I said to lennon818: your bio should lead your profile visitors to where they should go. The last line of your bio should give initiative for people to go shopping in your store. If you don't know what to do, I recommend checking your top competitors for reference.

35,"No idea honestly, that's something I'm trying to figure out. I think the best way is to post 1 or 2 really really good photos on days when your followers are often on, and at a time of day when they're often on and engaging with content.

The algorithm will still share your content to those followers it thinks aren't that interested (in your content) anymore, but where it's placed on their feed will depend on how likely the algorithm determines that user (it thinks is no longer interested) is going to interact with it. If a ton of your regular, and even a few irregular followers like something, the algorithm will take note of that and think ""if this person that doesn't usually engage with this accounts content is engaging with this post, maybe other alike accounts that don't usually engage will also like it"". In return, it will promote the post to those users that the algorithm thinks aren't interested in your content anymore, if those users like the post, now the algorithm will think maybe this user is still interested. Do this a few times over and eventually the algorithm will treat those once ""uninterested"" followers, and being interested in your content.

As you can see by my example, this is what happened with the home feed bug. The algorithm started to think  a set of your followers all suddenly lost interest in your content. And as a result, stopped showing your posts high up in their home feed.

EDIT: Also, the other part of the IG algorithm that you need to understand is how the explore page works. In short, in order to get a good spot on that page you need a high follower engagement rate.

Also I noticed once you create a business page, your reach dwindles, most likely because of the new Instagram algorithm looking to make money from ad revenue. 

My best advice would be to hire a content manager and an editor, make an editorial calendar and stick to a schedule. Have those people actively engage with your target market and make it a very personal experience. Just because someone has a lot of follows does not mean they are converting well. For us, having real conversations and genuine remarks gains our customer trust and sales. 

Social media can easily eat up too much of your valuable time, so I would recommend this be one of the first items that you contract out. Just my two cents.

Aside from creating good content, there are two things you want to be doing: get the attention of larger accounts and try to get involved with a pod/cohort. 

Getting your content reposted with a tag is the fastest way to get reach. Of course easier said than done but as someone that runs big social accounts we are looking for content as badly as you want to share it. 

A cohort/pod is a good way to get your photos in the discover tab. Try and ask around to see if you can get invited to a few, or create one yourself. A cohort/pod is where users with similar content and audiences like and comment on each other's photos. This will make your posts more favourable to the Instagram algorithm and get you featured on the discover tab. 

If you have something of value to offer, tag and win promotions are great too but just make sure that the audience you reach are relevant and not just empty likes.

To my surprise, I still couldn't get past 40 followers, so I kept trying at different times. After experimenting, I've come to the conclusion that the current limit seems to be about 40 followers every 20 minutes, or in other words, you can follow 120 people per hour in three intervals of 40 followers every 20 or so minutes (evenly spread out).

I think a good artist algorithm would be one that shows all kind of art and lets the user explore and lets the user get inspiration from different stuff instead of focusing on some.

32,"Instagram's algorithm is smart. If, when you post a photo, the same 10 users are always liking and commenting on it, the algorithm can quickly detect that something isn't right. This just isn't authentic behavior and IG knows that.

Alternatively, some people say that IG can pick up on the DM's you send to your engagement group members, so that when you say something like ""new post"" IG will know that you are participating in an engagement pod (I don't know if there is truth to this).

So to answer your initial question, I think that the algorithm is sophisticated enough to pick up on people who are participating in pods. But regardless, I think the bigger question is whether pods and engagement groups are worth the risk/effort.

My opinion is that Instagram engagement groups aren't going to cut it to help you increase your engagement. Instagram has designed the algorithm to account for more things than just engagement now.

In the past, Instagram pods worked because the algorithm had a heavy focus on likes + comments (i.e. a photo that got a lot of engagement right away was seen as being a good photo, thus it had a greater chance of being featured on the generic explore page etc).

However, IG's algorithm now takes into account [six key ranking factors](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/):

1. **Interest**: Instagram will determine how much it thinks you will care about a post based upon what you have previously liked. It tries to show you similar content in your feed.
2. **Recency**: Posts that were more recently posted will have a higher priority in the feed as opposed to ones that are older. This helps show posts more chronologically while still personalizing each home feed.
3. **Relationship**: Instagram takes into account the relationship you have with the poster. If you are constantly interacting with one another, you’ll see each other’s content more often.
4. **Frequency**: If you open the app and check your feed a lot, Instagram will be able to show you a greater variety of content. If you don’t check it as much, it will try to show you what it deems most relevant to you.
5. **Following**: If you follow more people, you may see less content from each user individually as Instagram will have more content to choose from to show you.
6. **Usage**: How long you spend browsing on Instagram will also determine if you are shown what Instagram deems as relevant. If you spend more time browsing, Instagram will have more content it can show you.

Knowing their ranking factors, you can conclude that an engagement pod will not help show your images to more people, rather it will just keep your content showing up on the feeds of your pod members (I hope this makes sense).

31,"Hey, so I ran your account through some analysis and I've got some ideas you can try.

So out of the three posts that were flagged as 'viral', all three were real life photos of products. Interestingly, your post with highest engagements (the euphoria bag), you kind of posted it twice close together with the second time performing well, but nowhere near as well as the first. The first was a carousel, the second was a single image. Generally your carousel posts get higher engagement across the board (Single Photo: 5.47%, Carousel: 6.30%). 

From your 20 most engaging posts, 16 are photos of products, whereas 4 are art/drawings of products/other etc. But from your last 20 or so posts on the account the majority of posts are in the 'other' category. So I think you need to revert back to only posting a) photos of products in the same style you have been and b) make sure they are carousels

Your product photos are really nicely done I think :) 

Weirdly, posts on Wednesday have a much higher than average 9.46% engagement rate for your account, but I think that's down to the fact that two of your three 'viral' posts were on Wednesday. Maybe something to think about, but also maybe not due to the sample size.

You also seem to be getting an 80/20% split on Negative Growth posts to Positive Growth posts. Which indicates that 80% of your posts haven't contributed to account growth. This is something to worry about and would absolutely be something an instagram algorithm would pick up on (maybe why it feels like reach has dropped off a cliff).

I think the good news is that the photos you do take are professional and very \~insta aesthetic\~ and will perform well again under the right circumstances. I'd maybe say change the profile picture (probably to the photo of the bag that did so well, or one of the pins), and change the name to not be the exact same as the @ handle so that it's more obvious what the account is/sells at a glance!

If you want higher engagement and more people to follow you from your post, you should add a call to action and ask questions more often.

With the Facebook groups, the admin would generally post a 'like thread' once or twice a day.

So it's like I said, no one knows for sure how the Instagram algorithm works, and I think it's very dubious that you can game the algorithm by deleting ghost followers.

On the other hand, if you have followers who are active users but simply not engaging with your posts, I recommend a strategy of engagement with your own followers to create reciprocal engagement.

28,"This is true as well, some people will see your post days later... part of the aggravating side of the IG algorithm.

However, as far as I know, and my theory has been proven to me before, when you first make your post IG only pushes it out to the top of a small percent of your followers' feeds. However, the quicker more of them engage with it will determine whether or not IG sees the post as a higher priority to push out to more people. So the trick for wider exposure is to get as much attention for the post as quickly as possible so it gets prioritized to more of your followers and does better in the browsing areas as well.

I don't have concrete evidence of this being exactly how it works but my tests show positive results. If I post at peak time for my followers being online I not only get more engagement from them but I also see more engagement from non-followers who found my post elsewhere on IG. 

EDIT: another frustrating thing to consider is that I have numerous online art friends who I always like to engage with their posts but for whatever reason IG doesn't always prioritize their posts in my feed so occasionally I'll go days without realizing I've missed several posts from close friends. Realizing that, I also realized that means some of even my close friends may be missing my posts and not even realize it.

So now the AI has decided to automatically show posts with people with black skin less. But that would still be based on historical engagement. 

Or the machine learning could be based on the users, like User A doesn't tend to engage with photos of POC. Therefore we'll show her less photos of POC.

**Keep Photos Bright**

Bright photos get more engagement than darker ones. And the difference is huge - so lift brightness, when possible.

**Be strategic with your comments**

The comments that you leave on Instagram also have the ability to deliver amazing results to you in the long run. Join Instagram pods. The more comments and likes you get, the higher in the explore page your post will be.

📷

**Use Colors that evoke positive emotions**

Avoid yellow, orange &amp; pink. Photos with grays, blues &amp; greens get the most engagement on Instagram.

📷

**Tag Influential Accounts**

Tagging influential account within your niches on the visual content after searching for the right one can let them know about your posts and help your post to show up on their feeds as well.

📷

**Organize a contest, too, as an alternative to winning the audience with hashtags**

If you can organize a contest with your Instagram account, you will be able to increase the number of followers as well as likes to your posts in a convenient manner. Follow and share, and you will get a free whatever, for example.

**Use Relevant Hashtags**

When you use relevant hashtags on your Instagram posts, the reach of the people is even better. A good app for hashtags suggestions is [**Ritetag**](http://ritetag.com/).

- Go onto your follower's pages, like/comment on their posts. Write something genuine to them.
- Record something just for them and send it to them in a DM/Snap.
- Record something that includes your followers in some way. Eg, if you were a rapper I'd say do a weekly 'follower rap', which were some rhymes about your followers and the photos they've been posting. Not sure what the DJ equivalent would be, but do that.
- Make sure you reply to every comment that gets left on your posts
- Particularly make sure you go and like/comment for anyone that's already like/commenting your posts

The basic idea is that they may have followed you because they liked something you did, but that the IG algorithm didn't bump you to the top of their list. By engaging with their content, they're more likely to check your stuff out + engage with it - and once they do it's a spiral effect, where IG decides they like seeing/engaging with you, so they'll start showing more of your stuff to them, which leads to more engagement, etc.

* **Post Consistency**

 * post about once a day, especially when first starting out. Once you have a couple thousand followers you can typically skip a day or two, but don't do it too often. You want to be posting at least once every 24 hrs

* **Post Quality**

 * post great photos. Good composition, stuff with lots of color tends to do well, just not overdone HDR. If you're lucky enough to be into landscapes and live in a desirable location like the PNW region, California, Iceland, Nordics, NZ, etc you'll probably do better than most at first. People love that.

* **Interactivity**

 * engage with mid-level influencers and befriend as many as you can, either through real world meet ups or just being friendly on IG. The more you engage with their photos the more chance you'll get them to engage with you and the more that people with an established following engage with your photos in the early hours of posting the better off you do with the IG algorithm game.

 * have a list of some popular ones (500K-1M+ photos posted) and a lot of niche ones (10K-300K photos posted) and use those on every post, just make sure they are tailored to your specific photography niche.

* **Post Planning aka Your 'Grid'**

 * try your best to have a cohesive style throughout your page and plan your posts ahead of time so that at least the first 3-6 posts all look like they belong to the same album. The more consistent your style the more polished your 'grid' will look and more people will want to keep scrolling or come back to your page.

* **Features**

 * get featured on community pages. Start small, tag ones that have a couple thousand followers to your posts (that are relevant) and then move up trying to get bigger fish. If you post great photos some will come naturally if you use their hashtags. It's amazing what a feature on a page with hundreds of thousands to millions of followers does to spike your growth for a day or two.

* **Don't Be Shitty**

 * no follow/unfollow bullshit, try to be at least somewhat genuine when commenting on photos, etc

* **Fun Factor**

 * Probably the most important rule of all. If you aren't having fun trying to build your IG following then don't bother doing it at all. Photography and the channels you use to showcase your work should be fun. I love interacting with people on IG and the platform largely drives me to get out more with my camera to have something to post. Unless you're a business with revenue implications, IG shouldn't have to always feel like work. Even if you *are* a business it can still be fun. If it's not, do something else.

These are just the things I've focused on, better at some than others, and have found some early success with. My page is about 2 months old and growing pretty steadily. Success is possible, but IG isn't a 'set it and forget it' type of play.",photography,"""ig algorithm""",,1496264964,2017-05-31 21:09:24,sensemaking,sensemaking,sensemaking
23,"So, Just try to find bigger accounts on IG that would like to give you shout out. 

Right now Instagram is pretty much about spending money on ads in order to get your post in front of new people, at the expense of your organic reach that would be crashed in time by the ads.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, when whey get you hooked on the ads, they would start placing some sorts of limits on your ads reach so you will be forced to spend more and more money on IG ads to get the same amount of likes and engagement you used you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say all this from my personal experience with IG/FB ads. I stared with $1 ads for one 24h on IG and in less than 3 months I had to spend 3$ to get the same amount of likes. Than in 3 more month it went to 5 $, until I reached $10 a post. I would get almost 2000 likes for $10. I was so happy. I thought I finally broke the IG algorithm but it was all for the worst. They than put a $50 dollar limit to my account, meaning that now I had to spend $50 to get the same likes I was getting for $10. That is when I stopped the IG ads all together and learned I have not only hurt my pocket, but also my organic reach was down the drain. 

As a 15,000 followers IG account, I would get easily, on average, 500 likes a post, but now it went down to only 100-200 likes per post... Yep, the majority of the people who are following me on IG are NOT getting any of my posts... They no longer know I even exist ...

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to grow my account from here, my IG account has only lost followers, almost 100 and is not working well at all.

It's better to have no followers than to have low-engaging followers.

Having lots of followers is great, but when they don't engage with your content it means that your content doesn't get shown to anyone. It doesn't show up in their feed, because they don't regularly engage with your content, and it doesn't show up in other followers' feeds because the 'test sample' that the IG algorithm shows your content to first hasn't engaged, so it doesn't show it to any more people.

A much better (albeit shitty) strategy for getting early high-engaging followers early on is to go and follow accounts who have already liked/commented on other photos in your niche. If those people follow you back, then your initial followers will be people whose natural behaviour is to like and comment on photos.

20,"Hey there, I'll share a few tips that I use which has very much improved my engagement, following etc. 

Whether you or anyone might like, a good following is essentially the only way to get brand recognition on social media. I noticed in a comment your goal is to share your work across a broad audience, well to go against what they say... build that following, the bigger you get the more big pages will pick up your work and feature it. It also in my opinions helps critique your work right away. I can tell what shots people like and don't like by my engagement. 

Now for rules of engagement I'll give a few tips: 

1. engage with other people, don't be a ghost. It's not helping to just post photos with a few hashtags and think your work ends there. Troll through hashtags, find photos you like and comment, like, etc. Do not critique, instagram isn't the place for that. You'll get butchered by loyal fans, friends, etc. of the people you commented on. 

2. Don't spam. Post once maybe twice a day. Also, post only photography content. If you want to post a meme or something post it for an hour or two max, but expect to lose a few followers. Sure people will argue that the more you post the more followers you gain; great - however, you'll end up with more ghosts, the instagram algorithm won't allow your images to show on people who follow you every time (I've not had a source for this but it is something I've heard from multiple people) and you tend to end up with more ghost followers this way. 

3. Don't get down on yourself if you don't take off. I've had weeks where I gained hundreds to a thousand followers and weeks where I've gained barely a hundred. It happens, don't stress about it just keep doing what you're doing and enjoy it. 

4. Don't worry about a niche, if you post good landscape photos, do it. If you post good street photography, do it. Look at all the big guys in terms of the urban / landscape scene most of them mix it up drastically. Niches are bullshit in terms of instagram.

5. Don't buy followers. Just don't. It looks shitty and you can tell easily. The only thing worth investing in is a like bot or comment bot. Don't do follow unfollow bots those are very frowned upon. 

6. Hashtags: figure out which feature page your photos would fit on, find their hashtags and repeat 30 times until you have a solid list. Save that list in your notes and post on every photo. However, don't post them in the caption.. It looks sloppy. Post your caption then copy your hashtags into the first comment. In your note put a few dots on a few lines to hide them completely when putting it in the comment. Also, don't look for trending hashtags... your photos will get lost. Just stick to the batch you found and don't be afraid to switch it up every now and then. 

If you follow these pretty closely it should work for you. It works for me. My engagement is very high in terms of percentages. Most big accounts are around 2%-10% likes to followers and mine is nicely around 20% and more. It will probably die down eventually since I'm only around 4000 followers but that's with 6 months of work into it and it's growing exponentially.

There may be a drop off point where by a friend with significant followers who posted several hours ago but received no likes is far enough down the feed you won't see them, but that happens now, just based solely on time meaning the same friend with loads of likes on a picture is far down my feed. And of those two scenarios said friend is much more likely to ask if I saw their popular picture.

Of course without seeing what the instagram algorithm actually does the argument is pretty pointless. Maybe they'll weight recent pictures significantly higher meaning that likes just make your photo move up the feed marginally. Maybe they'll weight people with lower follow counts higher to make sure they're not missed.

Try to understand the algorithm, do not combat it with tactics you find on the internet. At the end of the day it's a piece of code someone wrote, remember that.  
What I've noticed is that followers have to **engage** on a regular basis for you to get ranked high in their feeds, so **build** engagement and more importantly constantly grow your following, by reaching out to others in your niche.  
If you want to be successful on Instagram you'll have to build some kind of personal relationship to your audience. So how do you do that?  
Easy. Post **meaningful stories** that show before-after edits, things from the set when you shoot, some polls and constantly keep them posted on how their feedback impacted your feed actively. Engage with your follower's content by giving them genuine feedback. Get other **big creators** of your niche involved in your content, you'll not only get ranked higher, but you're also becoming suggested on their follower's explore.  
Most of the big accounts are suffering, because the Instagram algorithm ranks their engagement as low, hence their over all feed rank and visibility is very low too. Other than that I obviously suggest posting positive, high quality content with meaningful captions that build a personal relationship.

However... your juice can easily multiply as soon as people start liking and commenting.    If you have 30 hashtags in there to receive the interaction-juice, that's more effective than 14 gaining the interaction-juice.

Personally, I tell my clients 30 hashtags, most not large popular hashtags. I've seen the most amplification when 30 not-too-popular hashtags are used. Some do 14, some do 8.

* be posting regularly

* have a consistent brand / feed

* be active in your niche community

* be using relevant and not overly saturated hashtags (less than a million posts)

I disagree that you need to be following all of the followers of influencers similar to yourself - you'll just end up with a ton of people you're following and a messy feed. Plus, it doesn't look good when an account is following thousands of people. It looks spammy.

You want to know how to *actually* grow your account? Growth hack the Instagram algorithm. That's why engagement groups were / are so popular and people still use them. You absolutely need to have people with established followings in your niche interacting with your content near immediately after you post it. That's how you get in front of more and more people, hit the explore page, etc.

Whether you do that by joining engagement groups, or paying people who have built out networks of community pages that can push your content out, or reaching out to established pages and paying for / offering something in exchange for shout outs and collabs, or just by being social and having a ton of actual friends / IG acquaintances with big IG followings that will willingly engage with your content so you can 'ride their reach' - that part is up to you and your mileage may vary.

13,"Instagram's algorithm is now all based on engagement. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate. That shows Instagram that you make good content that your followers value, so Instagram’s algorithm will not only put you at the top of your current followers’ feeds but will also make you more visible for new followers on both the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. Inversely, if you have a lot of followers that don’t interact with your content, this tells Instagram you don’t make good content, so they limit your organic discoverability.  

Given how Instagram’s engagement-based algo works, what I have done to get my engagement rate up to 30% (and in turn drastically increase my organic reach), is block all of my ghost followers - ghost followers are either inactive accounts or are active (and have been following me for a while) but have not liked or commented on any of my posts. Blocking ghost followers has gotten me more likes and comments on all of my posts, and the new followers I do gain are only those that show active interest in my content by liking or commenting.
 
Right now, you get 400 likes with just under 4,000 followers, so you are receiving about a 10% engagement rate which is relatively good compared to most Instagram marketers who are not yet catering to the new engagement based algorithm. To further improve on this, you can block ghost followers manually or use an online service like I do to block the ghosts for you and improve your engagement rate and organic reach. I’m about a week in using EngagementGenie.com to block ghost followers and my engagement rate has improved by 20%, and I am gaining at least 50 new followers organically a day. I still have to post quality content on a consistent basis to see the follower growth, but I highly recommend losing the deadweight of ghost followers in order to grow with Instagram’s algo.

As you get started, post more often. I’ve seen plenty of articles that say post 3 times a day with different popular hashtags to grow your audience. Keep engaging with others’ content. Use long descriptions and tell a story or ask a question. Your descriptions are quite short and don’t give any insight into the reasoning behind the photo. Include the hashtags in your descriptions, not in the comments. The IG algorithm places a higher value on hashtags included in the description. Use geotags when you post, even if you’re not in the location when you publish. Try to identify a theme, think: “why would someone follow me?” Is it because of cars photos? European photos? Powerful portraits? Urban, landscape, and travel are too broad of topics. Narrow it down so people know what to expect.

Yes, people (other teachers/IG teachers) notice and talk about these accounts that buy followers. No one tracks their numbers day by day, that would be ridiculous. But it’s easy to see their rapid growth,  we talk about the frustrations we get from seeing this, which I will try to sum up but I realize a lot of this is more my thoughts versus a collective whole, so I don’t want to speak for everyone.

What gets under my skin about these people buying followers and engagement:

IG algorithm is ever changing...we don’t know exactly why a pic shows up in one feed but not another (even if they are both following the poster.) However, we do know that the more engagement (likes, swipes to pic 2, comments, etc.) a post gets soon after the post goes live, the more it will show up in feeds, and also the higher it will show up on hashtag searches or be shown to someone who follows that hashtag.  This is bothersome because then content from others is getting buried, even though they are getting the engagement organically. I ultimately run a side hustle through my IG (TpT and gasp, sponsors) so I need my content to get seen by others. I get frustrated seeing content by others blocking mine. Now I am not naive enough to think that my content is everyone’s cup of tea, so not everyone will like or comment, but even getting the views on a post (impressions and such) helps me to sell items or get more sponsors, which helps to support my family.  Furthermore, a lot of these posts that are getting thousands of likes quickly through buying them and bot followers (which will then like someone’s posts too) and not quality. Again, I know my content is not always the greatest, so don’t come at me for that, but some of these posts are doing the things many snark in here about: posting during the school day, kids faces, showing the school name/full classroom, etc. I know everyone as their own morals and rules they follow about these issues too, so this is a bit more biased.  I also, in situations like this, follow the rules and adhere to IGs community guidelines. I {know} the second I would buy a bot follower or pay for likes IG would close my account...what these people are doing is wrong and I think they should be held accountable for it, because they also KNOW what they are doing is not okay. I had a couple of people reach out to me and ask about the guidelines and I simply sent them to them and explained, they got it and have stopped and actually went in to delete (block) those followers that weren’t real.  Others argue with me that what they are doing is okay (it’s not) and continue to do it even after seeing the guidelines again in black and white.  I hear you (or others) saying it’s not my job to police IG, and I get that and will back off, and probably shouldn’t have brought it up in the first place. But a few of those accounts were popping up in my feed constantly, even though I refuse to follow them, and it got under my skin. I shouldn’t have let it, but it did.

  Being inconsistent causes your posts to get posted to a lower percentage of people that follow you and if those people happen to be low quality followers (ie, just flat out don't interact with your posts), those people won't interact with your post. The less people that interact with your post within the first hour it's on Instagram, the lower ""quality"" Instagram determines the content to be. That doesn't mean your art is low quality, just that Instagram's algorithm considers the post to be something people don't want to see.

  The only way to get more and more eyes on your posts is to post on a consistent basis. Instagram is less about getting one extremely high quality piece of content out every few weeks and more about marketing. If you want to grow your art page, you have to follow the same tactics that a business would follow to grow their following.

  My recommendation is to post small sketches daily if you can and interact with other artist's posts that put work out similar to yours, but have smaller communities (between 100-1000 followers but have a lot of interaction on their posts from those followers).

2. Put yours behind the scenes stories in the form of images and videos on your IG Page Story Section. This will help people to connect with your lifestyle and help you in building trust about your authority.
3. Convert your Profile to IG Business Profile. Why? because having a Business profile will help you in many aspects like it will allow you to put your links for your stories once you cross 10K IG Followers, it will allow you to see the insights for each of your posts
4. From the Posts, Insights that you get from step 3, find out What kind of posts(Images, Infographics, Videos, Memes, etc) are getting maximum engagement and what is the best time to post on your IG profile.
5. Leverage the Power of Videos in the Form of IG Timeline Videos, IG Story Videos, and IGTV Longform videos.
6. Leverage Proper Hashtags to make your posts searchable in the IG Platform.
7. Engage with your followers and spend some time on the platform. Do not try to Automate everything as the IG Algo is looking to Shadowban profiles that are using automation bots.
8. Use Location Tagging and People Tagging so that your followers can connect with the relevance and the context of the post more easily.

If it's good, it will prioritize it to be shown to other followers and maybe even people who don't follow you (through explore, hashtags).

The problem with having a lot of followers is that some of them might not be super into your work (either fake followers or insincere followers).

There is a big fear that over time the Instagram algorithm will begin to treat business accounts differently than personal accounts, similar to the way in which Facebook currently does it... that is to say, Facebook will only show your content to a subset of users, and if it gets good engagement it will show it to more users -&gt; if you want to guarantee people see it, you'll need to pay.

I stopped posting hashtags for a week. I put a hashtag on my next post, and I was still shadowbanned. 

I stopped using InstaStacked, for liking and f/ uf in my niche. One week later, I was still shadowbanned for hashtags, and I was no longer gaining the daily followers I used to. So, in my case, it was not the online service. I grew very frustrated by this point. 

So I dug and did some more research on why I could possibly still be shadowbanned by instagram. The reason I was shadowbanned was not on this list. The way Instagram's algorithm works-  engagement is number 1. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate. that shows Instagram that you make good content that your followers value, so Instagram’s algorithm will not only put you at the top of your followers’ feeds, but will also make you more visible for new followers on both the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. 

Inversely, if you have a lot of followers that don’t interact with your content, this tells Instagram you don’t make good content, so they limit your organic discoverability. My engagement rate was about 5%, getting around 600 likes a post with 10k followers.

These ghost followers dragged my engagement rate down into the depths of hell. So, insta's engagement-based algo hid my stuff from hashtags. My own followers weren't liking my content, so why would people on explore or popular hashtags like my content? Instagram shadowbanned me for having a bad engagement rate. Low engagement rate = lots of ghost followers.  

So naturally, what I’ve done to increase my engagement rate is block ghost followers – meaning people that have followed me for a while and have never liked or commented on anything. My engagement rate is now up to 20% (10k followers, avg 2k + likes), and I frequently make it to the top of a popular hashtag and am gaining new followers very quickly. 

I had 5k ghost followers to block so I knew I could not do that all manually even though I would like to, so I wouldn't have had to pay to get them blocked lol. CrowdBabble.com will give you a list of all of your ghost followers for you to block manually. Or I am pretty sure the only service that will block all of your ghost followers for you (within Insta's blocking limits and terms of service) is EngagementGenie.com, which is what I used.

TLDR; block ghost followers to increase your engagement rate to get your shadowban lifted and be promoted by Insta's Engagement-Based Algorithm.

Build a following in the shop small niche or in the entrepreneurship niche first, and then promote small businesses and their owners once you have a following in the niche. 

From my experience, the fastest way I have been able to build a following on Instagram is to post quality content at least once daily, constantly engage in my niche, and keep a high engagement rate. There are lots of online services that will engage with users in your niche for you to help you grow a following, but remember to keep a high engagement rate on Instagram as you are growing because Instagram's algorithm will put you in low visibility if you have a lot of fake, ghost followers that do not like or comment on any of your posts. 

It's important to block ghost followers because Instagram’s new algorithm is all based on engagement. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate.

100 likes seems like a decent amount for 1600 followers. Instagram's algorithm is showing your images to a percentage of your followers, not all of them. As the app develops it seems to decrease that number for accounts that aren't paying to promote, etc.

I have 2800 followers and used to receive 150ish likes per post, and since the apparent recent algorithm change, it has plummeted to around 50 likes per post.  
Posting in the evening is all well and good, but remember that is when most people are also posting, so there is more competition for your post to be seen.  


Those accounts using no hashtags may have an external following, or a high number may be close acquaintances or they may be featured on other accounts/linked to, or the photographer may be a bit of a celeb in some circles. I know people that have die-hard fans that are waiting for their next post and will like literally anything they post! Perhaps their work just has that je ne sais pas that is hitting the nail on the head for people right now.  


Keep doing what you're doing and don't worry too much about the likes. Don't put all your eggs in one (Instagram) basket - find other sites/platforms to build a follower base too. I find that nailing the hashtags in my Stories brings a lot more views and engagement than my actual posts anyway.

Ghost followers dragged down my engagement rate. Having a low engagement rate when Instagram's algorithm is based on engagement is not fine. Instagram will put you in limited visibility if you have a lot of followers but they do not like or comment on your posts because this shows Insta's algo that your followers do not like your content so your content must be low-quality.

If IG algo is anything like Googs algo then the more ""authority"", aka. trustworthiness, an account has and you're tagged in it, the more widely distributed you'll be and you'll show in more feeds.

&gt;Why can't you just scroll through everything? Do you not eventually see pretty much all the posts anyway (just not in chronological order)?

""Eventually"" is the key. I tried this, but it just took so, so long.

IMO, Instagram got it wrong where Twitter got it right. My Twitter feed is perfectly palatable because it's mostly chronological-ish, with a clearly marked ""while you were away"" section for paid ads and the odd sponsored tweet tucked in between chronological tweets. I don't mind seeing them, and they don't ruin my feed.

Instagram went from 0-90 overnight and my feed was impossible to navigate. It took so much longer to see ""everything"". 

I was following over 100 people on Insta before, but I brought that down to about 35 people to see if it would improve the feed. It didn't. 

So I've given up on the feed. Now I just go straight to my profile, click ""following"", and manually look at everyones profile. Now that I'm only following 35 people it's easy enough to do this. Once in a while I check on some of the old accounts that I unfollowed too.

That, imo, is where Instagram has messed up. Twitter's feed algorithm is still faster and easier than looking at everyone I'm following individually. Instagram's algorithm is the opposite. 

I know I sound bitter and disgruntled. I know Instagram is providing a free service. I know I'm the product. But there has to be a middle ground, where Instagram can promote ads without *completely* ruining the feed. Twitter has already proven that it's possible to do this.

I'm new to this, you mentioned the instagram algorithm, how do you understand the two posts a day to positively impact your reach? Your posts show up higher or more frequently on your followers timelines? You appear on ""suggested users"" list more?

What I would like to know more about is the selection for the top posts of a hashtag. According to what I've read, this should simply be the most liked posts of the past 24 hours, but the tags I follow (seem to) have posts with more likes than the ones appearing in the ""top""?

Also, is there a set time when the ""top"" items change? or is this individual to hashtags, is it consistent? It seems obvious one should post immediately after the refresh to have 24 hours time to gather likes? (in hopes of being ""stickied"", which seems to me like the jackpot)

Finally, is there any further purpose/advantage to hashtags after the initial 10 minutes that your post remains within reasonable scrolling distance from the top?

2,"Here has been my experience with being shadowbanned. 

I stopped posting hashtags for a week. I put a hashtag on my next post, and I was still shadowbanned. 

I stopped using InstaStacked, for liking and f/ uf in my niche. One week later, I was still shadowbanned for hashtags, and I was no longer gaining the daily followers I used to. So, in my case, it was not the online service. I grew very frustrated by this point. 

So I dug and did some more research on why I could possibly still be shadowbanned by instagram. The way Instagram's algorithm works-  engagement is number 1. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate. that shows Instagram that you make good content that your followers value, so Instagram’s algorithm will not only put you at the top of your followers’ feeds, but will also make you more visible for new followers on both the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. 

Inversely, if you have a lot of followers that don’t interact with your content, this tells Instagram you don’t make good content, so they limit your organic discoverability. My engagement rate was also about 10%, getting around 1000 likes a post with 10k followers. 

These ghost followers dragged my engagement rate down into the depths of hell. So, insta's engagement-based algo hid my stuff from hashtags. My own followers weren't liking my content, so why would people on explore or popular hashtags like my content? Instagram shadowbanned me for having a bad engagement rate. Low engagement rate = lots of ghost followers.  

So naturally, what I’ve done to increase my engagement rate is block ghost followers – meaning people that have followed me for a while and have never liked or commented on anything. My engagement rate is now up to 20% (10k followers, avg 2k + likes), and I frequently make it to the top of a popular hashtag and am gaining new followers very quickly. 

I had 5k ghost followers to block so I knew I could not do that all manually even though I would like to, so I wouldn't have had to pay to get them blocked lol. CrowdBabble.com will give you a list of all of your ghost followers for you to block manually. Or I am pretty sure the only service that will block all of your ghost followers for you (within Insta's blocking limits and terms of service) is EngagementGenie.com, which is what I used.

Lots of images, like the shoddy one above that I whipped together, flooded Instagram, as desperate Instagrammers begged their followers to turn on post notifications so they would ‘never miss another post’.

One unexpected downside of slavishly following that advice, is that your beloved Instagram app will start glowing with a busy red dot of notifications as accounts post their photos into the stream.

Given how regularly some Instagrammers post their lovely photos, by turning on post notifications your app will almost always have its little red dot of notification alight, pestering you to click through to see the latest filtered feed from accounts you are following.

My advice to users is to NOT turn on post notifications unless you are completely wedded to an Instagrammer or able to ignore that red dot beckoning to you to come and see something.

1,"Hi I grew my [dog's account](http://instagram.com/yahtzeedog) to 15k followers. I've also played with a few other accounts in different genres to test out different strategies

General points:

* When starting a new account, just go ahead and post 9-12 photos. You want to build your post count up a bit so that as people scroll through your account it doesn't look empty. Don't worry too much about getting likes for these first photos

* General posting schedule I use is 2-3 times a day. I target US commute times (early morning, early evening), or you can use something like Prime for Instagram (iOS App) down the track to work out the best posting times. (spoiler: It basically says early morning/evening)

* If your goal is affiliate marketing, your best bet is to create 3-4 accounts in the same niche, all with a slightly different twist. It takes about as much effort (and time) to grow 3-4 accounts as it does a single account, and you'll end up having a larger audience to monetise from your affiliate stuff.

* Don't automate anything. It really doesn't take a lot of effort to organically grow an instagram account. Automation is obvious and looks stupid.

* Make sure you reply to all comments on your photos, make sure you engage with your follower's posts.

* Make sure you post videos and stories. It's almost 2017 and video's only going to grow.

***Main Growth Strategy***

I can generally hit 1,000 followers in 3-4 days with this method:

I use a variation on following/unfollowing that captures high engaging followers, which in turn accelerates organic growth. It goes like this:

1. Post a photo. Search on a hashtag you want to rank on (eg #GermanShepherd)

2. Scroll past the ""top posts"" to the recent posts. These are photos that have been posted in the last x seconds/minutes, so the users engaging with those posts are probably active right now.

3. For anyone that has ""x likes"", tap on that, and follow all the people that have liked that post. These are users whose default behaviour is to like posts. If they follow  you back, they are more likely to like your photos.

4. Similarly, follow anyone who has made a genuine comment on that post to get followers that are more likely to make comments

5. After a week, use something like StatusBrew to unfollow anyone who doesn't follow you back.

My experience is that this is still the most effective strategy for quality followers. Worth noting:

* This strategy will ensure photos you post will receive more engagement. In turn, this will make the IG algorithm more likely to show your photos to your followers, and will eventually push you into ""top posts"" and the discovery (""Recommended for you"") sections, which really drives organic growth.

* Do this before and after your post photos. Anyone you like using this strategy has been online recently, so they're probably going to check out your account and like/comment on that sweet photo you just posted. If you post a photo and it starts getting likes/comments right away, this bumps you up in the IG algorithm.

* Instagram will cap how many people you can follow at a time through the app (apparently 60-100). When it stops you, take a break (I usually set an alarm for 1h15m)  - respect that they're telling you to slow down.

* This strategy will stop working once you hit the point where there are 7k people you follow that also follow you back (Instagram caps the amount of accounts you can follow at 7k). At this point you need to either unfollow those people (I'd suggest people not engaging with your content), or you need to find an alternative growth strategy.

Some people hate the follow/unfollow method. Some people love bots.

Me, I've found this is the most effective way to attract high-engaging followers.

either that or post pics of models/model wannabes who're pretty. follower count will rack up immensely

0,"There are people you are reporting they got their account de-ghosted after reducing their activities. There is no guarantee that it will happen, but there is at least a chance. And therefore, it seems to be not a good idea to continue to be very active on IG - in terms of following, unfollowing &amp; liking other accounts/pics or uploading pics. 

Lets try that to find our how long you are shadow-banned and without risking too much activity:

1) Lower all your activities. No unfollowings, no followings (or not many, maybe 5-10/day). It could (!) be worth to give some likes to your followers or pics on your exlore feed (maybe 5-20/day) to pretend that your account is still active and you are on holidays. We wanna show the IG algo. that we are still active, but we ""behave better"".
2) Upload a pic :camera: with maybe 3 hashtags. Choose at least one that has only less than 1,000 posts (the less, the better), e.g. for the pets niche it could be the hashtag ""#kittiesgalore"" (currently less than 700 posts on IG). Take time to find such a hashtag.
3) Confirm with another account ""B"" (&amp; another IP/proxy) or by asking a friend who is NOT following your account: is that uploaded pic ""invisible"" (by searching this not often-used hashtag)?
4) Then check every day exactly that hashtag via acc. B: is the pic visible?
- If not, the break was not long enough and then dont do anything.
- If the pic is visible --&gt; CONGRATS! :-D You have your acc. back! Please post here how long it took and how you lowered your settings. You can try to increase your settings slightly (but keep in mind the ""dog house theory"" that was mentioned here by keepitreal55: after a de-ghosting, your account might be under surveillance, so dont increase your activities massively (due to high risk of getting ghosted again))

0,"As with any product focused instagram page you should be considering the instagram page as a customer acquisition tool, but more importantly trying to draw direct lines between people discovering you in instagram and purchasing your products on your website. If you can start working out which posts are bringing in customers then you need to keep posting that kind of content!

As for instagram specific metrics, Carousels and Videos do well for you with 6.02% and 5.41% Public Engagement Rate respectively.  I'd definitely try and post more regularly though, at the moment you're only 3 posts back after an 11 month break so just keep going with the new content and see what still works/doesn't work/works now. Long hiatuses in between posts will almost certainly harm your instagram algorithm discoverability though!

0,"Nah, she automates it. So her deal is that she was one of the first people to try and “crack” the IG algo—she sold courses and had a huge FB group and kind of invented comment pods (or at least invented calling them that and their most common forms.) She was a huge proponent of MassPlanner, the most common bottling tool for awhile. MP doesn’t exist in that form anymore but there are other tools like Jarvis, or she might have coded her own. Looooong story short, I’m sure it’s 99% automated. 

What’s funny/sad to me is that the result of all of that work and years of effort is 100k followers, mediocre engagement, and using your kids for diaper ads. Is this living the dream?",blogsnark,"""IG algo""",,1577677742,2019-12-30 3:49:02,,,

Also, followers and likes rarely translated to customers. Instagram is more like your portfolio instead of a commission market.

0,"Here has been my experience with being shadowbanned. 

I heard putting too many of the same hashtags could cause a shadowban. So, I stopped posting hashtags for a week. I put a hashtag on my next post, and I was still shadowbanned. 

I stopped using InstaStacked, an insta automation software, for liking and f/ uf in my niche. Two weeks later, I was still shadowbanned for hashtags, and I was no longer gaining the daily followers I used to. So, in my case, it was not the online service. I grew very frustrated by this point. 

So I dug and did some more research on why I could possibly still be shadowbanned by instagram. I found that the way Instagram's algorithm works-  engagement is number 1. If almost all of your followers are liking or commenting on your posts, you have a good engagement rate. That shows Instagram that you make good content that your followers value, so Instagram’s algorithm will not only put you at the top of your followers’ feeds, but will also make you more visible for new followers on both the explore page and popular hashtags in your niche. 

Inversely, if you have a lot of followers that don’t interact with your content, this tells Instagram you don’t make good content, so they limit your organic discoverability. My engagement rate was about 5%, getting around 600 likes a post with 10k followers.

These ghost followers dragged my engagement rate down into the depths of hell. So, insta's engagement-based algo hid my stuff from hashtags. My own followers weren't liking my content, so why would people on explore or popular hashtags like my content? Instagram shadowbanned me for having a bad engagement rate. Low engagement rate = lots of ghost followers.  

So naturally, what I’ve done to increase my engagement rate is block ghost followers – meaning people that have followed me for a while and have never liked or commented on anything. My engagement rate is now up to 20% (10k followers, avg 2k + likes), and I frequently make it to the top of a popular hashtag and am gaining new followers quicker than ever before. 

I had 5k ghost followers to block, so I knew I could not do that all manually even though I would like to, so I wouldn't have had to pay to get them blocked lol. CrowdBabble.com will give you a list of all of your ghost followers for you to block manually. Or I am pretty sure the only service that will block all of your ghost followers for you is EngagementGenie.com, which is what I used. Maybe removing your ghost followers to revamp your engagement rate will help get you un-shadowbanned like it did for me. Hope my personal experience helps!
